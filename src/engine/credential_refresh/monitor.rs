//! The credential-refresh monitor: owns the lease registry and the tick loop
//! that keeps every live container's staged credential file fresh.
//!
//! Design priorities, in order:
//! 1. **Never write to a dead session's path.** Three independent defenses:
//!    the RAII lease (INV-6), a monotonic generation re-checked before every
//!    write, and a path-existence check inside the atomic writer (INV-7).
//! 2. **Never miss a live credentialed container.** Registration happens at the
//!    single spawn choke point, before the child process starts.
//! 3. **Survive every exit path.** The lease drops on success, error, panic
//!    unwind and teardown; the monitor loop parks (zero CPU) when no lease is
//!    live and never makes a refresh failure fatal to a session (INV-4).
//!
//! The loop runs on a dedicated background thread with its own current-thread
//! Tokio runtime so it depends on no ambient runtime; it is started lazily on
//! the first lease and parks when the registry empties.
