//! Live-session credential tracking: the lease registry and the refresh
//! monitor (WI-0107 §3).
//!
//! A [`CredentialLease`] is the RAII proof that a credentialed container is
//! live; the [`CredentialRefreshMonitor`] owns the [`LeaseRegistry`] and keeps
//! every live container's staged credential file fresh without ever writing to
//! a dead session's path. See `lease.rs` and `monitor.rs` for the invariant
//! walkthroughs.
