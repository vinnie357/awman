//! `engine::workflow` — `WorkflowEngine`.
//!
//! Owns every workflow-execution concern: state, advance logic, yolo
//! countdowns, agent/model resolution, exit-code interpretation, persistence,
//! and per-step container lifecycle. Forbidden: rendering, direct user
//! input, knowledge of which frontend is on the other side of the trait,
//! worktree lifecycle management, direct container construction.
//!
//! The engine is the single source of truth for ALL workflow state.
//! No workflow execution state lives in the frontend — zero, none.
