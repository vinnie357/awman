## Global Developer Context

You have access to a persistent global context directory mounted at /awman/context/global.

This directory is the developer's personal, cross-project workspace — maintained by them and shared across all agents, projects, and workflows they run with awman. It is meant to be portable and durable: a personalized addition to per-project CLAUDE.md files that travels with this developer everywhere.

The directory may contain:
- Personal coding style preferences and conventions the developer always wants followed
- Notes on recurring mistakes, things to avoid, or common gotchas encountered across projects
- Shared tools, scripts, or templates that may be used freely
- Any standing guidance the developer wants applied to all of their work

Instructions:
1. Read all files in /awman/context/global at the start of your task to understand the developer's preferences and any standing guidance they have left.
2. You SHOULD write to files inside /awman/context/global to record any significant insights or mistakes, or leave guidance you want future agent sessions to know based on your interactions with the developer. The developer will review and curate these files over time.
3. Treat the contents of this directory as extremely valuable developer guidance and context — refer to it throughout your work.";

const REPO_PROMPT: &str = "\
## Repository-Specific Context

You have access to a repository-specific context directory mounted at /awman/context/repo.

This directory contains knowledge and guidance specific to the project you are currently working in. It is maintained collaboratively by the developer and agents who have worked on this codebase before.

The directory may contain:
- Architecture notes and key design decisions
- Project-specific conventions, patterns, and best practices
- Known gotchas, workarounds, and areas of technical debt
- Domain knowledge and business logic documentation
- Notes from previous agent sessions working on this codebase

Instructions:
1. Read all files in /awman/context/repo at the start of your task to orient yourself to the project-specific context.
2. You SHOULD write to files in /awman/context/repo to capture any significant insights discovered during your work, document decisions made, or leave guidance for future agent sessions. The developer will review and curate these files.
3. Treat the contents of this directory as extremely valuable project context — refer to it alongside the codebase itself throughout your work.";
