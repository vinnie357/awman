//! The task-evaluation delegation seam.
//!
//! [`TaskEvaluator`] is defined here, at Layer 1, but implemented at
//! Layer 2 (`command::commands::squad::LocalTaskEvaluator`). This is the
//! same pattern `WorkflowEngine` uses to reach higher layers: a lower layer
//! that needs a higher layer's capability accepts a trait the higher layer
//! provides, rather than importing it directly (grand-architecture Tenet 1).
//!
//! The scheduler owns the run's lifecycle in the store — it writes the
//! `squad_runs` row before calling [`TaskEvaluator::evaluate`] and records
//! the terminal status afterwards. The evaluator therefore never touches the
//! store; it is a pure function from an [`EvaluationRequest`] to an
//! [`EvaluationOutcome`], which keeps Layer-1 store ownership intact and makes
//! the scheduler trivially testable against a mocked evaluator.
