//! The one-time "here is your squad key" snippet.
//!
//! The squad daemon has always minted a bearer key on its first start, but the
//! key was printed as a bare line with no indication of how the CLI or TUI were
//! meant to present it back. This module renders the missing half: the exported
//! environment variable ([`AWMAN_SQUAD_KEY`]) and the shell startup file to put
//! it in, so a first run leaves the user with a working client rather than a
//! secret they cannot spend.
//!
//! Rendering is a pure function of (key, shell) so the wording is unit-testable
//! and the caller decides where the text goes — stdout for the CLI, the squad
//! tab's message area for the TUI.
