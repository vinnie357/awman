//! Launching a task's leader agent in a container (Layer 1).
//!
//! [`SquadAgentLauncher`] is the engine-side counterpart to
//! `ExecWorkflowCommand`'s leader drive: it seeds the persistent task
//! directory with the dynamic-workflow reference assets, resolves the agent's
//! container options, stamps squad's identity (container name + the two labels)
//! onto them, and runs the agent through `Arc<dyn AgentRuntimeEngine>`.
//!
//! It deliberately does *not* build the [`AgentRunOptions`] or resolve the
//! leader prompt — those need Layer-2 config resolution and are handed in via
//! [`LeaderRunSpec`]. What is genuinely Layer 1 lives here: filesystem seeding,
//! option resolution, container naming, label attachment, and the
//! build → run → wait cycle.
