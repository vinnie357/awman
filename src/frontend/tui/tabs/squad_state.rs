//! State for the squad tab's task list and its background poller.
//!
//! `SquadTabState` is `Some` exactly when a `Tab` is the squad tab. It owns the
//! shared snapshot the poller publishes and the renderer reads, plus the
//! focus/cancel/attach handles that drive polling and the attach session. It
//! holds NO business logic: every value in `SquadSnapshot` comes from a
//! `TaskGateway` call, and every field here is UI/lifecycle state.
