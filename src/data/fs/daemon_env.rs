//! Persistence seam for the squad daemon's payload environment (WI 0116 §5).
//!
//! The squad daemon receives the values named by `env(VAR)` overlays over its
//! authenticated loopback socket and holds them in memory
//! ([`set_daemon_overlay`](crate::data::config::env::set_daemon_overlay)). That
//! leaves one gap: the OS restarting the daemon with no client present —
//! launchd `RunAtLoad` at the next login, a systemd restart after a crash. The
//! daemon comes back with an empty overlay and stays that way until some CLI or
//! TUI invocation happens to push, and scheduled tasks in that window run
//! without their tokens.
//!
//! [`DaemonEnvStore`] closes that gap. It is the *persistence* layer, not a
//! transport: a push is still the only way a value reaches a running daemon,
//! and the store only carries values across an OS-initiated restart.
//!
//! This module is Layer 0: it owns the trait, the [`NoStore`] fallback, the
//! configuration and reporting types, and the pure helpers. The `KeychainStore`
//! implementation lives in `engine::squad::env_store` because the OS keychain
//! shell-out shims are Layer 1 (`engine::auth::keychain`) and Layer 0 may not
//! import them.
//!
//! # Three non-negotiable rules
//!
//! An unattended daemon must not be able to hang, and must not lose data to a
//! store it cannot reach. Every implementation and every caller obeys:
//!
//! 1. **Never block.** Every keychain call runs under [`KEYCHAIN_CALL_CAP`]
//!    (see [`call_with_cap`]). A locked login keychain, an absent Secret
//!    Service, or any prompt that does appear is a timeout that logs a warning
//!    and continues with whatever the daemon already has. It is never an error
//!    that fails a start or a run.
//! 2. **Never authoritative.** A pushed value always replaces a stored one. The
//!    store is a cold-start hint, not a source of truth.
//! 3. **Never fatal.** A store or load failure degrades that daemon to
//!    [`NoStore`] for its lifetime. Squad keeps working exactly as it does with
//!    persistence off; the only thing lost is surviving an OS-initiated
//!    restart.
