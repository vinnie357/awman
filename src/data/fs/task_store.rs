///
/// `repo_scope` is the task's **effective root** — the single host directory a
/// run is bound to — captured once when the task is created and never widened
/// or re-derived afterwards. It is one of:
///
/// * the durable per-task workspace `~/.awman/squad/tasks/<name>/workspace/`
///   ("Default Task Workspace"), which is a plain directory and *not* a git
///   repository; or
/// * a custom folder or repository the user chose ("Custom Folder / Repo").
///
/// `mount_scope` records which of those it is, and therefore whether a run may
/// use a git worktree:
///
/// * [`MountScope::GitRoot`] / [`MountScope::Cwd`] — the effective root was
///   inside a git repository at creation time, so every run is worktree-
///   isolated ([`Task::uses_worktree`] is `true`). The two variants differ only
///   in how much of that repository is mounted.
/// * [`MountScope::Directory`] — the effective root is a plain directory (the
///   default task workspace, or a custom folder that was not a git repository
///   at creation). It is mounted whole and directly; no worktree is created,
///   because there is no repository to branch one from.
///
/// Worktree usage is therefore derived from "was the effective task root a git
/// repository", **as evaluated at creation** — exactly like `mount_scope`'s
/// existing capture-once convention. If a custom repository is later deleted,
/// moved, or de-initialised, the run fails loudly at git-root resolution rather
/// than silently degrading to a direct mount.
///
/// Independently of which mode was chosen, the durable workspace directory is
/// always created and always mounted into the task's leader container at the
/// `context(workflow)` path, so a task has one task-scoped persistent location
/// for its whole lifetime.
