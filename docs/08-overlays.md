# Overlays

Overlays give agent containers access to host resources — directories, environment variables, and personal skills libraries. Each step in a workflow can define its own overlays, ensuring isolated resource access across the task.

---

## Overview

An overlay "opens a door" from the container into the host, mounting a directory, injecting an environment variable, or making a skill available. Unlike most container configurations, overlays from all sources are **additive** — your global config, per-repo config, `AWMAN_OVERLAYS` environment variable, `--overlay` flags, and per-step overlays all combine into a single final resource list.

Overlays are expressed using a unified syntax that works anywhere: `dir()`, `ssh()`, `env()`, and `skill()` expressions. No matter where you configure them — config file, environment variable, CLI flag, or workflow TOML — the syntax is consistent.

---

## Overlay types

### `dir(host:container[:permission])`

Mounts a host directory into the container at a specified path.

**Syntax:**
```
dir(HOST_PATH:CONTAINER_PATH[:ro|rw])
```

- `HOST_PATH` — absolute path or `~/`-prefixed (expanded to your home directory).
- `CONTAINER_PATH` — absolute path inside the container (or `~/` for the container user's home).
- `permission` — optional; `ro` (read-only, default) or `rw` (read-write).

**Examples:**
```
dir(/var/data:/mnt/data:ro)
dir(~/personal-prompts:/mnt/prompts)
dir(/shared/fixtures:/workspace/fixtures:rw)
```

If the host path does not exist when you launch the session, awman exits with an error before launching any container — this catches typos and missing prerequisites (such as `~/.ssh`) early instead of letting Docker silently auto-create an empty mount source.

### `ssh()`

Mounts your SSH key directory into the container for Git operations and SSH-based tools.

**Syntax:**
```
ssh()
```

This is shorthand that expands to mounting `~/.ssh` from the host as read-only into `~/.ssh` inside the container. It takes no arguments.

**Why:** When your workflow needs to push code to a remote repository or authenticate via SSH, you need access to your private keys. `ssh()` makes this automatic without manual directory wiring.

**Example use case:**
```toml
[[teardown]]
type = "push_branch"
overlays = ["ssh()"]
```

**Security:** SSH keys are always mounted read-only. The agent cannot modify or replace your keys, only use them for authentication.

### `env(VAR_NAME)`

Injects a host environment variable into the agent container's environment.

**Syntax:**
```
env(VAR_NAME)
```

- `VAR_NAME` — the exact name of the environment variable on the host (e.g., `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).
- Multiple vars are expressed as multiple `env()` calls — not comma-separated inside one call.

**Examples:**
```
env(GITHUB_TOKEN)
env(ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
```

Multiple vars in different sources (comma-separated in `AWMAN_OVERLAYS`, repeated CLI flags, or multiple array entries):
```
env(GITHUB_TOKEN), env(ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
```

If the named variable is not set on your host, it is silently absent from the container environment — this is not an error. This lets you list optional variables that may only be set in some contexts (CI vs. local development).

For a squad task, "your host" means something different: the value is
resolved by the **squad daemon**, not by whatever shell ran `awman squad add`
or `awman squad edit`. The daemon is a long-lived background process, so it
needs its own copy of any `env(VAR)` name a task declares, kept in sync as
your shells come and go. See [Squad: Task environment
values](12-squad.md#task-environment-values) for how a value reaches the
daemon, what it means when the daemon doesn't have one yet, and how to check
or fix that with `awman squad env`. A squad task's leader agent is shown in its
prompt which of the task's `env()` names the daemon actually holds a value for
— see [Squad: What the leader agent is told about
them](12-squad.md#what-the-leader-agent-is-told-about-them).

**Example use case:**
```toml
[[teardown]]
type = "create_pull_request"
overlays = ["env(GITHUB_TOKEN)"]
```

### `skill(*)`

Mounts all hand-authored global awman skills into the agent container. Pulled libraries are not implicitly included by this wildcard; choose them explicitly with `skill(LIBRARY)` or `skill(LIBRARY/SKILL)`.

**Syntax:**
```
skill(*)
```

This makes every hand-authored skill in `~/.awman/skills/` available as a slash command inside the container. Pulled libraries live below `.library/` and are opt-in.

### `skill(name)`

Mounts a single named skill into the agent container.

**Syntax:**
```
skill(NAME)
```

- `NAME` — a hand-authored skill name, a pulled library name, or a pulled library and skill separated by `/`.
- Multiple named skills are expressed as multiple `skill()` calls — not comma-separated inside one call.

**Examples:**
```
skill(lint)
skill(review)
skill(fetch)
skill(superpowers)
skill(superpowers/brainstorming)
```

Multiple skills:
```
skill(lint), skill(review)
```

`skill(superpowers)` mounts the whole pulled library. `skill(superpowers/brainstorming)` mounts only the `brainstorming` skill from that library. A hand-authored skill takes precedence when it has the same name as a pulled library, so `~/.awman/skills/superpowers/` wins over `~/.awman/skills/.library/superpowers/`.

Pulled libraries and their skills are read from `~/.awman/skills/.library/<library>/`, using the subdirectory selected when the library was pulled. A named skill that cannot be found is reported before the container launches. Names can contain at most one `/`; `skill(a/b/c)` is rejected with `skill(name) supports at most one '/' (library/skill); got 'a/b/c'`. Each part of the name must be a plain directory name: empty, `.` and `..` parts (as in `skill(superpowers/..)`) are rejected with `skill(name) segments must not be empty, '.' or '..'`.

### `context(scope[:permission])`

Grants agent containers access to a persistent context directory on the host and delivers system prompt instructions explaining the context's purpose.

Context overlays combine a **directory mount** (persistent files on the host) with **system prompt injection** (agent-specific delivery of context instructions), unified into a single overlay expression. This allows agents to access both shared knowledge and per-project accumulated context.

**Syntax:**
```
context(SCOPE[:ro|rw])
```

- `SCOPE` — one of `global`, `repo`, or `workflow`:
  - `global` — persistent cross-project developer preferences (`~/.awman/context/global/`)
  - `repo` — project-specific context (`~/.awman/context/repo/{owner}/{repo}/`)
  - `workflow` — per-workflow shared workspace for multi-agent coordination (`~/.awman/context/workflow/`)
- `permission` — optional; `ro` (read-only) or `rw` (read-write, default).

**Examples:**
```
context(global)        # personal preferences, read-write
context(repo)          # project context, read-write
context(workflow:ro)   # workflow workspace, read-only
context(global:rw)     # personal preferences, explicit read-write
```

**What happens when you use `context()`:**

1. awman mounts a directory into the container so the agent can read and (if `rw`) write files there.
2. awman injects a system prompt explaining what the context directory is, how to use it, and what files might be inside.
3. The directory and prompt are automatically managed by awman — you don't need to create them manually.

**Agent system prompt support:**

Most agents natively support system prompt injection. If your agent does not (e.g. `maki`, `crush`), awman still mounts the context directory, but the agent will not be automatically notified via system prompt — you can reference the mounted directory in your prompt manually. For details, see [Context overlays in depth](#context-overlays-in-depth) below.

**Note on `rw` vs `ro`:**

- `context(global)` and `context(repo)` default to `rw` because they are designed for agents to write accumulated knowledge back for future sessions.
- `context(workflow)` is typically `rw` so agents can share state between steps.
- Use `:ro` for read-only access if you want to ensure agents cannot modify the context directory (e.g. in CI/CD or shared environments).

## Configuration sources

Overlays can be configured in five places. All sources are merged; the order below shows precedence for conflict resolution (lower priority first):

| Priority | Source | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 1 (lowest) | Global config `~/.awman/config.json` | `"overlays": ["dir(~/shared:/mnt/shared:ro)"]` |
| 2 | Per-repo config `.awman/config.json` | `"overlays": ["skill(lint)"]` |
| 3 | `AWMAN_OVERLAYS` environment variable | `export AWMAN_OVERLAYS="dir(/data:/mnt:ro),env(TOKEN)"` |
| 4 | `--overlay` CLI flags | `--overlay "ssh()" --overlay "env(GITHUB_TOKEN)"` |
| 5 (highest) | Per-step overlays in workflows | `overlays = ["ssh()"]` in TOML |

---

## Merge semantics

All sources are **additive** — they are combined into a single final list. Special rules apply to avoid conflicts:

### Directory overlays

When different sources specify the **same host path**:
- The **higher-priority source** wins for the container path.
- The **more restrictive permission always wins** — `:ro` beats `:rw` regardless of priority. If a lower-priority source declares `:ro`, a higher-priority flag cannot escalate it to `:rw`.

When different sources specify **different host paths** mapping to the **same container path**, both mounts are applied and a warning is logged (Docker will shadow one with the other).

### Skills overlays

Skills use **union/additive** semantics:
- If *any* source specifies `skill(*)`, all hand-authored global skills are mounted; pulled libraries still require an explicit library or library/skill reference.
- Named skills from all sources are accumulated. If global config specifies `skill(foo)` and a per-step overlay specifies `skill(bar)`, both `foo` and `bar` are mounted.
- When `skill(*)` is active from any source, the accumulated named skills list is ignored (all skills are already mounted).

If a session needs a pulled library, use its explicit `skill(library)` or `skill(library/skill)` reference instead of relying on `skill(*)`.

### Environment variable overlays

Environment variable names are deduplicated by name. If multiple sources list the same `env(VAR)`, the final result includes that variable exactly once.

### Context overlays

Context overlays use **union** semantics — all specified scopes are mounted and all prompts are combined. If the same scope appears in multiple sources (e.g. `context(global)` in both global config and a step's overlays), it appears exactly once in the final mount list. The combined system prompt always presents scopes in the order: global, repo, workflow (workflow last).

---

## Global config

**Path:** `~/.awman/config.json`

```json
{
  "overlays": [
    "dir(~/shared-prompts:/mnt/prompts:ro)",
    "env(ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)",
    "skill(*)"
  ]
}
```

This configuration applies overlays to all agent sessions on your machine unless overridden by a per-repo config.

### Table reference

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `overlays` | string array | `[]` | List of overlay expressions to apply to all sessions. Merged additively with per-repo, `AWMAN_OVERLAYS`, and `--overlay` flags. |

---

## Per-repo config

**Path:** `.awman/config.json` (in the repository root)

```json
{
  "overlays": [
    "skill(lint)",
    "skill(review)",
    "env(GITHUB_TOKEN)"
  ]
}
```

This configuration applies overlays to all agent sessions in this repository only. It merges additively with the global config, so if your global config specifies `skill(*)` and your repo config specifies `skill(lint)`, both are effective (the wildcard mounts everything).

### Table reference

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `overlays` | string array | `[]` | List of overlay expressions for this repo. Merged additively with global config, `AWMAN_OVERLAYS`, and `--overlay` flags. |

---

## Environment variable

Set `AWMAN_OVERLAYS` in your shell profile to inject overlays without modifying any config file:

```sh
export AWMAN_OVERLAYS="ssh(),dir(~/team-data:/mnt/data:ro),env(GITHUB_TOKEN),skill(fetch)"
```

Expressions are comma-separated. This source has higher priority than config files but lower priority than `--overlay` flags.

---

## CLI flag

The `--overlay` flag is available on all agent-launching commands: `chat`, `exec prompt`, and `exec workflow`. Pass it once per expression:

```sh
awman chat --overlay "ssh()" --overlay "env(GITHUB_TOKEN)"
```

Or comma-separate multiple expressions in a single flag:

```sh
awman chat --overlay "ssh(),env(GITHUB_TOKEN),skill(lint)"
```

This source has the highest priority among global/repo/env/flag sources, but per-step overlays in workflows override it.

`awman squad add` also accepts repeatable `--overlay` flags, and the squad
interview offers the same overlay step. These task overlays are saved with
the task and applied to its evaluation and workflow containers, together with
the other overlay sources. See [Squad: Giving your squad a task](12-squad.md#giving-your-squad-a-task)
for the task-creation flow; this page remains the authoritative reference for
overlay syntax and merge behavior.

---

## Workflow step overlays

In workflow TOML or YAML files, each step can define its own `overlays` array:

**TOML example:**
```toml
[[step]]
name = "research"
prompt = "Research the topic..."
overlays = ["ssh()", "skill(search)", "skill(fetch)"]

[[step]]
name = "write"
prompt = "Write the report..."
overlays = ["dir(/data/reports:/workspace/reports:rw)", "skill(*)"]
```

**YAML example:**
```yaml
steps:
  - name: research
    prompt: "Research the topic..."
    overlays:
      - "ssh()"
      - "skill(search)"
      - "skill(fetch)"
  
  - name: write
    prompt: "Write the report..."
    overlays:
      - "dir(/data/reports:/workspace/reports:rw)"
      - "skill(*)"
```

Per-step overlays merge additively with all other sources (global, repo, `AWMAN_OVERLAYS`, flags), and take highest priority for conflict resolution.

### Workflow-level overlays

Workflows can specify a top-level `overlays` array that applies to every step in the workflow:

**TOML example:**
```toml
[workflow]
title = "Multi-step implementation"

overlays = ["context(repo)", "context(workflow)"]

[[step]]
name = "plan"
prompt = "Plan the implementation..."

[[step]]
name = "implement"
prompt = "Implement according to the plan..."

[[step]]
name = "test"
prompt = "Test the implementation..."
```

**YAML example:**
```yaml
title: Multi-step implementation
overlays:
  - "context(repo)"
  - "context(workflow)"

steps:
  - name: plan
    prompt: "Plan the implementation..."
  
  - name: implement
    prompt: "Implement according to the plan..."
  
  - name: test
    prompt: "Test the implementation..."
```

Workflow-level overlays apply to all steps unless overridden by step-level overlays (which take highest priority). This is useful for context overlays that you want all steps to share (e.g. `context(repo)` so every agent in the workflow has access to the project's accumulated knowledge).

### Setup and teardown steps

Setup and teardown steps (the phases that run before and after workflow steps) also support overlays:

**TOML example:**
```toml
[[setup]]
type = "run_shell"
command = "apt-get update"
overlays = ["dir(/cache:/var/cache:rw)", "env(DEBIAN_FRONTEND)"]

[[teardown]]
type = "push_branch"
overlays = ["ssh()"]

[[teardown]]
type = "create_pull_request"
overlays = ["env(GITHUB_TOKEN)"]
```

Setup and teardown steps support `dir()`, `ssh()`, and `env()` overlays. They do **not** support `skill()` or `skill(*)` (skills are only meaningful for agent containers; setup and teardown are host operations or custom containers).

---

## Common use cases

### Git operations with SSH

When your workflow pushes branches or interacts with SSH-based Git hosts:

```toml
[[teardown]]
type = "push_branch"
overlays = ["ssh()"]
```

The `ssh()` overlay mounts `~/.ssh` into the container, making your private keys available for Git authentication.

### GitHub API operations

When your workflow creates pull requests or interacts with GitHub:

```toml
[[teardown]]
type = "create_pull_request"
overlays = ["env(GITHUB_TOKEN)"]
```

The `env(GITHUB_TOKEN)` overlay injects your GitHub token so the step can authenticate to the GitHub API.

### Anthropic API authentication

When your agent needs an Anthropic API key:

```json
{
  "overlays": ["env(ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)"]
}
```

Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your shell environment; awman passes it into the agent container.

### Personal skills library

To make your custom skills available in every session:

**Global config** (`~/.awman/config.json`):
```json
{
  "overlays": ["skill(*)"]
}
```

All skills you've created with `awman new skill` now appear as slash commands in every agent session.

### Personal developer context

To share your personal coding preferences, style rules, and past-mistake notes across all projects:

**Global config** (`~/.awman/config.json`):
```json
{
  "overlays": ["context(global)"]
}
```

Create `~/.awman/context/global/` and add files documenting your preferences (e.g. `coding-style.md`, `common-mistakes.md`). Every agent you run will receive your guidance automatically via system prompt, without needing to duplicate it across project-specific `CLAUDE.md` files.

### Project-specific context

To give agents access to your project's accumulated architecture notes and team knowledge:

**Per-repo config** (`.awman/config.json`):
```json
{
  "overlays": ["context(repo)"]
}
```

awman maintains `~/.awman/context/repo/{owner}/{repo}/` automatically. After each agent session, you can add or update files in this directory (e.g. `architecture.md`, `gotchas.md`). Future agents working on the project will be guided by this accumulated knowledge.

### Selective skills in a workflow

When different steps need different skills:

```toml
[[step]]
name = "lint"
prompt = "Lint the code..."
overlays = ["skill(lint)"]

[[step]]
name = "review"
prompt = "Review the PR..."
overlays = ["skill(review)"]

[[step]]
name = "refactor"
prompt = "Refactor the code..."
overlays = ["skill(lint)", "skill(refactor)"]
```

Each step only mounts the skills it needs, keeping resource access minimal.

### Shared team data

Mount shared reference data or fixture files:

```json
{
  "overlays": [
    "dir(/var/team-data/fixtures:/mnt/fixtures:ro)",
    "dir(~/team-templates:/mnt/templates:ro)"
  ]
}
```

---

## Context overlays in depth

Context overlays give you and your agents a persistent, shared workspace on disk — combined with automatic system prompt instructions explaining what that workspace is and how to use it. They solve a recurring problem: how do you avoid re-explaining the same project context, developer preferences, or workflow state to every agent you run?

A context overlay is three things at once:

1. **A directory on your host** — persistent files you create and manage, located under `~/.awman/context/`.
2. **A system prompt** — automatically injected into the agent's instructions, explaining the context and what files to expect.
3. **A unified syntax** — expressed as `context(scope[:permission])`, just like every other overlay.

The three scopes:

| Scope | Location | Purpose | Shared across |
|-------|----------|---------|----------------|
| **global** | `~/.awman/context/global/` | Personal coding preferences, style rules, recurring mistakes to avoid | All projects and workflows |
| **repo** | `~/.awman/context/repo/{owner}/{repo}/` | Project-specific architecture notes, gotchas, accumulated team knowledge | All agents working on this repo |
| **workflow** | `~/.awman/context/workflow/` (per workflow invocation) | Shared state and coordination between steps in a multi-agent workflow | All steps in the same workflow run |

The squad daemon keeps each task's durable context in
`~/.awman/squad/tasks/{name}/workspace/`. It is a task-scoped location in
addition to the ordinary global, repo, and workflow contexts. A task's
workspace is long-lived: it is created once and reused for every evaluation
of that task, including when the task's primary workspace is a custom folder.
It is never recreated for each run. See [Squad: Task workspaces](12-squad.md#task-workspaces)
for how this location is selected and preserved.

### When to use each scope

**Global context** (`context(global)`) — standing guidance that applies everywhere: personal coding style, common gotchas you've learned to avoid, architectural patterns you always want followed, links to frequently-referenced docs. Example: a `~/.awman/context/global/coding-style.md` that says "Always use async/await, never callbacks." Every agent you run, in any project, reads it.

**Repo context** (`context(repo)`) — project-specific knowledge worth preserving: architecture decisions unique to this codebase, known workarounds and technical debt, team conventions that differ from your personal style, notes from previous agent sessions ("we tried X, it failed because Y"). Example: after an agent refactors your auth layer, you add notes to `~/.awman/context/repo/myorg/myproject/auth-layer.md` so the next agent avoids the pitfalls the previous one discovered.

**Workflow context** (`context(workflow)`) — multi-step coordination where each step needs to see which steps completed, notes left by earlier steps, and a shared workspace. Example: a `plan` step writes `/awman/context/workflow/plan.md`, the `implement` step reads it and builds accordingly, the `document` step reads both. No step re-discovers what earlier steps decided.

### System prompt injection

When you use `context()`, awman automatically injects a section into the agent's system prompt explaining the context directory and what to do with it. The exact wording may vary slightly; the shapes are:

**Global context prompt** — explains that `/awman/context/global` is the developer's personal, cross-project workspace, instructs the agent to read all files at the start of the task, and encourages it to write back significant insights or mistakes for future sessions.

**Repo context prompt** — explains that `/awman/context/repo` holds knowledge specific to the current project, maintained collaboratively by the developer and prior agents, and instructs the agent to read it for orientation and write back decisions and discoveries.

**Workflow context prompt (dynamic)** — regenerated for each step with live progress, e.g.:

```
## Workflow Context

You are running as part of the multi-agent "Build API Implementation" workflow,
managed by awman.

Your current step: implement (step 2 of 3)

Workflow progress:
  [✓] plan — completed
  [→] implement — in progress (this is you)
  [○] test — pending

You have access to a shared workflow context directory mounted at /awman/context/workflow.
Every agent step in this workflow shares this directory and can read and write files there.

Instructions:
1. At the start of your task, read any files left by previous steps in
   /awman/context/workflow — intermediate results, shared state, scripts, or instructions.
2. Write your outputs, notes, and any state that later steps will need into
   /awman/context/workflow, using descriptive file names.
3. You are one step in a coordinated workflow — produce your deliverables reliably,
   document what you produced, and leave the workspace ready for the next step.
```

### Setting up context directories

**Global** — create the directory and add files describing your standing guidance:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.awman/context/global
```

Useful files: `coding-style.md` (language conventions), `common-mistakes.md` (gotchas to avoid), `decision-log.md` (standing decisions like "we use Postgres, not SQLite, in user-facing code"). Then enable it in `~/.awman/config.json`:

```json
{ "overlays": ["context(global)"] }
```

**Repo** — after working with an agent on a project, capture project knowledge:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.awman/context/repo/myorg/myproject
```

Useful files: `architecture.md` (layered design, module boundaries), `gotchas.md` (known traps, e.g. "changing a workflow step's name breaks resumption"). Enable it in the repo-local `.awman/config.json`:

```json
{ "overlays": ["context(repo)"] }
```

**Workflow** — these directories are created automatically per workflow invocation; you don't set them up by hand. Reference them in the workflow's overlays and have steps read/write `/awman/context/workflow/`:

```toml
[workflow]
title = "Implement Feature"
overlays = ["context(global)", "context(repo)", "context(workflow)"]

[[step]]
name = "plan"
prompt = "Review the repo context at /awman/context/repo. Write a detailed plan to /awman/context/workflow/plan.md."

[[step]]
name = "implement"
prompt = "Read /awman/context/workflow/plan.md and implement it. Write progress notes alongside it."

[[step]]
name = "document"
prompt = "Read the plan and notes from /awman/context/workflow/ and write user-facing docs."
```

### Agent system prompt support

Most awman-compatible agents support system prompt injection natively, so the context prompt is delivered automatically. If an agent doesn't, awman still mounts the context directory — you just reference it manually in your prompt.

**Native injection:**

| Agent | Delivery method |
|-------|-----------------|
| **claude** | CLI flag `--append-system-prompt-file` (recommended) |
| **codex** | CLI flag `--config developer_instructions=<text>` |
| **opencode** | Auto-reads `AGENTS.md` in the mounted context directory |
| **copilot** | Env var `COPILOT_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS_DIRS` |
| **antigravity (agy)** | CLI flag `--add-dir` + auto-reads `AGENTS.md` |

**No native injection** (directory mounted, prompt not auto-delivered — reference it manually): **maki**, **crush**.

**Degraded support** (replaces the entire system prompt rather than appending; awman prepends a baseline preamble to restore tool guidance, and logs a `warning` at startup): **gemini** (deprecated), **cline**. Prefer `claude` for the smoothest context experience.

### Read-only vs read-write

Context overlays default to **read-write (`rw`)** because the entire point is to **accumulate knowledge** across sessions — an agent should be able to update `common-mistakes.md`, add notes after a complex task, or leave files for the next workflow step. Making them read-only by default would defeat that purpose.

Use `:ro` when you want to share guidance without letting agents modify it:

- **CI/CD pipelines** — `context(repo:ro), context(global:ro)` so agents read project knowledge but don't write to shared context.
- **Shared/untrusted environments** — `context(global:ro)` to share your preferences without letting the agent add to them.
- **Archival/reference** — `context(repo:ro)` for a directory meant to stay fixed.

### Managing context effectively

**Good practices:** keep files short and focused (one topic per file); write for future-you (assume no prior context); link to code (commits, paths, line numbers); explain *why*, not *what*; curate periodically and remove outdated guidance; for teams, consider version-controlling context files in the repo.

**Avoid:** context bloat (dumping every thought turns signal into noise); stale guidance ("we tried X, it failed" after you've fixed X); secrets in context files (never store API keys or passwords); vague notes ("be careful with auth" vs "`refresh_token()` mutates state under the state lock").

### Context FAQs

- **Works with the TUI?** Yes — context overlays behave identically in TUI, CLI, and API modes.
- **Two workflows at once?** Each invocation gets its own `/awman/context/workflow/` directory keyed by the workflow UUID; they don't interfere.
- **Share across teams?** Not directly — context lives under `~/.awman/` on your host. For team context, add it to the repo's `docs/`, check context files into the repo, or use shared mounted directories.
- **How big can files be?** No hard limit, but keep them readable; split files that exceed a few thousand lines.
- **Binary files?** Technically allowed, but not useful — context is for human-readable guidance (Markdown, JSON, YAML).

---

## Path expansion

### Host-side `~` expansion

Paths starting with `~/` are expanded to your home directory when the overlay is parsed:

```
dir(~/my-data:/container/data:ro)  →  dir(/home/alice/my-data:/container/data:ro)
ssh()                              →  dir(/home/alice/.ssh:~/.ssh:ro)  [internally]
```

This expansion happens at parse time, so the paths are absolute in all downstream layers.

### Container-side `~/` expansion

Container paths starting with `~/` are expanded at container launch time using the agent's home directory:

```
dir(/host/data:~/data:ro)
```

For root-based containers (the default), `~/` becomes `/root/`. For non-root containers, `~/` becomes `/home/{username}/` where the username comes from the agent's `Dockerfile`. This ensures `ssh()` and other `~/`-based paths land in the correct location for both root and non-root containers.

---

## Error handling

### Malformed expressions

Malformed overlay expressions cause the command to exit immediately with a descriptive error:

```
error: malformed overlay expression (missing colon): "notvalid"
error: 'skill()' requires an argument; use skill(*) to mount all skills or skill(name) for a specific named skill
error: 'env(A, B)' has multiple arguments; use separate env() calls for each variable
error: 'context()' requires a scope; use context(global), context(repo), or context(workflow)
error: 'context(global:rx)' has invalid permission; use 'ro' or 'rw'
```

The command does not proceed — you must fix the syntax before launching.

### Missing host paths

If a configured host path does not exist when you launch the session:

```
error: overlay host path '/nonexistent/data' does not exist
```

The launch fails rather than asking Docker to create an empty bind-mount source.
If a directory is optional across environments (for example, CI versus a local
machine), add the overlay only in the environments where that path exists.

### Missing named skills

If a named skill is neither a hand-authored skill nor a pulled library:

```
error: named skill 'nonexistent' not found in ~/.awman/skills or ~/.awman/skills/.library
```

For a library skill, the error identifies both the library and the missing skill, for example:

```
error: skill 'brainstorming' not found in library 'superpowers' (looked for a SKILL.md in ~/.awman/skills/.library/superpowers/skills/brainstorming)
```

A skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md`. A directory inside a library
that has no `SKILL.md` is reported the same way — it is not mountable as a
skill.

The command exits immediately. This catches typos before the container launches, preventing silent failures.

### `AWMAN_OVERLAYS` errors

If `AWMAN_OVERLAYS` contains a malformed expression, the command exits with an error that includes the variable name:

```
error: malformed AWMAN_OVERLAYS: 'skill()' requires an argument (use 'skill(*)' or 'skill(name)')
```

This makes the source immediately obvious so you can fix your shell profile.

### Removed forms

The old config schema used `{ "overlays": { "skills": true, "directories": [...] } }`. This format is no longer supported:

```
error: config overlay format is out of date
```

Update your config to use the new `"overlays": ["skill(*)", "dir(...)"]` format. The old `envPassthrough` field is also deprecated; use `env()` overlay expressions instead.

## Workflow source order example

Given a realistic setup:

**Global config** (`~/.awman/config.json`):
```json
{ "overlays": ["dir(~/team-shared:/mnt/shared:ro)", "context(global)"] }
```

**Per-repo config** (`.awman/config.json`):
```json
{ "overlays": ["skill(lint)", "context(repo)"] }
```

**Environment**:
```sh
export AWMAN_OVERLAYS="env(GITHUB_TOKEN)"
```

**CLI invocation**:
```sh
awman exec workflow workflow.toml --overlay "ssh()"
```

**Workflow** (top-level):
```toml
overlays = ["context(workflow)"]

[[step]]
overlays = ["skill(review)"]
```

**Merged result for this step:**
- Directories: `/home/alice/team-shared:/mnt/shared:ro` (from global config)
- Skills: `lint` (from repo config) + `review` (from step)
- Environment: `GITHUB_TOKEN` (from `AWMAN_OVERLAYS`)
- SSH: `~/.ssh:~/.ssh:ro` (from CLI flag)
- Context: `global` (from global config) + `repo` (from repo config) + `workflow` (from workflow level)
- Combined system prompt: global context instructions, then repo context instructions, then workflow context instructions

## Security considerations

- All overlay mounts are printed in the full Docker command before each session — you always see exactly what is mounted.
- `:ro` (read-only) prevents the agent from modifying the overlaid directory. Skills are always read-only.
- Only use `:rw` when the task genuinely requires write access to that directory.
- Environment variable overlays are masked in displayed commands (values shown as `***`) to avoid leaking secrets in logs.
- SSH keys are always mounted read-only — the agent cannot modify or replace your keys, only use them for authentication.
- **Context overlays (`rw` default):** Because `context(global)` and `context(repo)` default to read-write, agents can persist files to your host that will be automatically injected into future agent runs. This is intentional — it allows agents to accumulate and refine knowledge. Use `:ro` (e.g. `context(repo:ro)`) if you want read-only context in CI/CD or shared environments. See [Context overlays in depth](#context-overlays-in-depth) for more details on managing context.

See [Security & Isolation](04-security-and-isolation.md) for additional details on container transparency and isolation.

## Troubleshooting

### "Path does not exist" warning

If you see this warning for a path that should exist, check:
- Is the path spelled correctly?
- Is it an absolute path or properly `~`-expanded?
- Does the host path actually exist? Try `ls -la /path/to/check`.

### Skills not available in container

- Is `skill(*)` or `skill(skillname)` configured?
- For a hand-authored skill, does it exist in `~/.awman/skills/<name>/`?
- For a pulled library, does it exist in `~/.awman/skills/.library/<library>/` and is the requested library or library/skill name correct?
- Check the full Docker command printed before the session — it should include `-v` mounts for each skill.

### Git operations failing with "Permission denied"

- Is `ssh()` configured in the step's overlays (or elsewhere)?
- Does `~/.ssh` exist on your host?
- Is the SSH key in `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` or equivalent?

### Environment variable not present in container

- Is `env(VAR_NAME)` configured?
- Is the variable set in your current shell? Try `echo $VAR_NAME`.
- If the variable is unset on the host, it is silently absent from the container — this is not an error, by design.

### Context directory not visible in container

- Is `context(global)`, `context(repo)`, or `context(workflow)` configured?
- Check the full Docker command printed before the session — it should include `-v` mounts for `/awman/context/...`.
- The context directory is auto-created if it doesn't exist. If directory creation fails (permission denied), awman will report an error.

### Agent not receiving context system prompt

- Is your agent one that supports system prompt injection? See [Context overlays in depth](#context-overlays-in-depth) for which agents support native injection.
- For agents that support it (e.g. `claude`), is `context(...)` configured?
- If your agent doesn't support native injection (e.g. `maki`), the context directory is still mounted; reference it manually in your prompt.

### Context files not being updated

- Is the context overlay `rw` (read-write)? By default they are `rw`, but check your config.
- The context directory is writable by agents. Files written by one session will be visible to the next session.
- If you want to prevent agents from modifying context, use `:ro` (e.g. `context(repo:ro)`).

# Startup-gated bindings

Startup-gate bindings are declared by the orchestrator's `request.json`, not by
the ordinary overlay flag. Their guest paths are limited to `/workspace`,
`/review`, `/work`, `/data`, `/mnt`, and `/output` or descendants. Binding paths
must not overlap. During a gated launch ordinary overlays may not overlap
`/bin`, `/sbin`, `/usr`, `/lib`, `/lib64`, `/etc`, `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`, or
`/.awman/startup-gate`.
