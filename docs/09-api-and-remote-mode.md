# API & Remote Mode

awman can be driven over HTTP instead of from an interactive terminal. This guide covers both halves of that:

- **[API mode](#api-mode)** — the *server*. `awman api start` exposes awman's sessions and subcommands over HTTP so scripts, CI pipelines, and any HTTP client can drive them. This half also covers [non-interactive (headless) operation](#non-interactive-headless-operation), which applies to plain CLI use too.
- **[Remote mode](#remote-mode)** — the *client*. `awman remote …` is a thin client for an awman API server on another machine, with live log streaming and TUI pickers, so you can dispatch work to a build host as if it were local.

You do not need remote mode to use the API (curl works fine), and you do not need to understand the HTTP surface to use `awman remote`. Read whichever half you need.

---

# API mode

API mode exposes awman's session and subcommand execution over HTTP. Start a persistent server with `awman api start`, then drive sessions and subcommands from scripts, CI pipelines, or any HTTP client — no interactive terminal or TUI required.

A **session** in API mode is conceptually identical to a TUI tab: a named, isolated workspace bound to a working directory. Subcommands dispatched to a session (`exec workflow`, `chat`, etc.) execute exactly as they would in a TUI tab — inside a Docker container, with all the same security and isolation guarantees.

API metadata, credentials, and output logs are recorded durably under
`~/.awman/api/` for auditability. The shared SQLite database is stored at
`~/.awman/data/awman.db`.

API mode is for request-driven sessions and commands. To hand recurring work to
a group of agents that pick it up on their own, build a [squad](12-squad.md)
instead. The API server and the squad daemon behind your squad share the
database and are mutually exclusive on one machine.

---

## When to use API mode

API mode is useful for:

- CI pipelines that trigger `exec workflow` or `exec prompt` runs and poll for results
- Scripts or tooling that execute workflows and retrieve output programmatically
- Remote integrations where the awman server runs on one machine and clients run elsewhere
- Audit-heavy environments where a complete durable record of every agent action is required
- One-shot agent invocations from scripts using `awman exec prompt` or `awman exec workflow`

For single interactive sessions, use `awman chat` instead.

---

## Quickstart — copy-pastable examples

These examples assume a server running on `127.0.0.1:9876`. The server speaks HTTPS by default with a self-signed cert, so curl needs `-k` (or `--cacert ~/.awman/api/tls/cert.pem`) to skip verification. Pass `--dangerously-skip-tls` at server start if you'd rather use plain HTTP.

```sh
# 0. Start the server (one-time; stores its api_key.hash under ~/.awman/api).
#    The plaintext key is shown ONCE in the startup banner; copy it now.
awman api start --port 9876 --workdirs "$HOME/my-project" --background

# Stash the key the banner just printed:
KEY=<paste-key-from-banner>
SERVER=https://127.0.0.1:9876
```

### Local session

A local session binds to a directory that's already on the server's allowlist (configured via `--workdirs` or `api.workDirs`).

**Using `curl`:**

```sh
# 1. Create a session bound to a workdir
SESSION=$(curl -sk -X POST "$SERVER/v1/sessions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"type\":\"local\",\"workdir\":\"$HOME/my-project\"}" | jq -r .session_id)

# 2. Dispatch a one-shot prompt; the response carries the command_id
CMD=$(curl -sk -X POST "$SERVER/v1/commands" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  -H "x-awman-session: $SESSION" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"subcommand":"exec","args":["prompt","Summarise recent changes","--non-interactive"]}' \
  | jq -r .command_id)

# 3. Stream the output until the command finishes
curl -Nsk "$SERVER/v1/commands/$CMD/logs/stream" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  | while IFS= read -r line; do
      case "$line" in
        "data: [awman:done]") break ;;
        data:\ *)              printf '%s\n' "${line#data: }" ;;
      esac
    done

# 4. Close the session
curl -sk -X DELETE "$SERVER/v1/sessions/$SESSION" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

**Using `awman` itself** (no manual session handling — `awman remote` handles it):

```sh
# One-time setup so subsequent commands don't need flags
awman config set --global remote.defaultAddr "$SERVER"
awman config set --global remote.defaultAPIKey "$KEY"

# Start a session bound to the local directory and capture its ID
SESSION=$(awman remote session start "$HOME/my-project" \
  | awk '/Session started:/ {print $NF}')

# Dispatch the same prompt and stream its output live
awman remote exec prompt "Summarise recent changes" --non-interactive \
  --session "$SESSION" --follow

# Close the session
awman remote session kill "$SESSION"
```

### Remote session (server clones a Git repo)

A remote session asks the server to clone a Git repo into an ephemeral directory under `~/.awman/sessions/<session-id>/`. The clone is deleted when the session is closed.

**Using `curl`:**

```sh
# 1. Create a remote session — the server does the clone for you
SESSION=$(curl -sk -X POST "$SERVER/v1/sessions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "type": "remote",
    "repo_url": "https://github.com/org/my-project",
    "branch": "main"
  }' | jq -r .session_id)

# 2. Run a workflow against the clone
CMD=$(curl -sk -X POST "$SERVER/v1/commands" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  -H "x-awman-session: $SESSION" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"subcommand":"exec","args":["workflow","aspec/workflows/implement-feature.toml","--work-item","0053"]}' \
  | jq -r .command_id)

# 3. Poll status until terminal
while true; do
  STATUS=$(curl -sk "$SERVER/v1/commands/$CMD" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" | jq -r .status)
  echo "status=$STATUS"
  [ "$STATUS" = "done" ] || [ "$STATUS" = "error" ] && break
  sleep 5
done

# 4. Closing deletes the on-server clone
curl -sk -X DELETE "$SERVER/v1/sessions/$SESSION" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

**Using `awman` itself:** the `awman remote session start` command currently expects a path that already exists on the server, so for remote (clone-on-server) sessions create the session via curl as shown above, then drive it with `awman remote exec --session <id>`:

```sh
# Drive the just-created remote-clone session with awman
awman remote exec workflow aspec/workflows/implement-feature.toml \
  --work-item 0053 \
  --session "$SESSION" --follow
```

---

## One-shot scripted execution (`exec`)

The `exec` subcommand group provides two commands for running agent tasks non-interactively from scripts, CI pipelines, or the API server — without a persistent session or TUI.

### `awman exec prompt [<prompt>]`

Launches an agent container with a pre-supplied prompt. Behaves identically to `awman chat`, except the initial prompt is baked into the launch arguments rather than requiring a live terminal session.

```sh
# Run a single task and exit
awman exec prompt "Fix the failing tests in src/api"

# Non-interactive: agent executes and exits; output goes to stdout
awman exec prompt "Summarise recent changes" --non-interactive

# Use a specific agent and model
awman exec prompt "Refactor the auth module" --agent codex --model gpt-4o

# Send a GitHub issue as the prompt
awman exec prompt --issue 84

# Prepend your own context to the issue
awman exec prompt "Security review for: " --issue 84

# Full autonomous run
awman exec prompt "Implement caching for the API layer" --yolo --non-interactive
```

When neither a positional prompt nor `--issue` are provided, the command exits with an error. When `--issue` is used alone, the positional prompt is optional. When both a positional prompt and `--issue` are provided, your text appears first, followed by the issue content.

**Flags accepted by `exec prompt`:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--issue <ref>` | GitHub issue number, URL, or `owner/repo#N`; see [GitHub Integration](10-github-integration.md) |
| `--non-interactive` / `-n` | Run in print/batch mode — agent executes and exits |
| `--plan` | Read-only analysis mode — agent cannot modify files |
| `--allow-docker` | Mount host Docker socket into the container |
| `--overlay=<SPEC>` | Apply overlay(s) for this run; see [Overlays](08-overlays.md) |
| `--auto` | Auto-approve file edits; prompt before shell commands |
| `--yolo` | Fully autonomous mode — skip all permission prompts |
| `--agent=<name>` | Override the agent for this run |
| `--model=<NAME>` | Override the model for this run |

All flags behave identically to their `chat` counterparts. See [Agent Sessions](03-agent-sessions.md#flags-common-to-chat-and-other-agent-launching-commands).

---

### `awman exec workflow <path>` / `awman exec wf <path>`

Runs a workflow file. The work item is optional — when provided, it's used for template variable substitution within the workflow.

```sh
# Run a workflow without a work item
awman exec workflow ./aspec/workflows/implement-feature.toml

# Alias: exec wf
awman exec wf ./aspec/workflows/implement-feature.toml

# Associate a local work item for template variable substitution
awman exec workflow ./aspec/workflows/implement-feature.toml --work-item 0053

# Or fetch a GitHub issue instead
awman exec workflow ./aspec/workflows/implement-feature.toml --issue 84

# Non-interactive workflow run
awman exec workflow ./aspec/workflows/review.toml --non-interactive
```

`exec workflow` and `exec wf` are identical — `wf` is a short alias.

**Work item template variables:** When no `--work-item` or `--issue` is given, prompt templates that use `{{work_item_number}}`, `{{work_item_content}}`, or `{{work_item_section:[Name]}}` are left unexpanded with a warning:

```
warning: workflow uses {{work_item_content}} but no --work-item was provided; placeholder left unexpanded
```

When `--work-item <N>` is provided, awman resolves the work item file from the configured work items directory and substitutes all template variables. When `--issue <ref>` is provided, awman fetches the GitHub issue and substitutes the same template variables.

**Workflow state files:** When no work item or issue is given, the state file is keyed by the workflow file's name and content hash:

```
~/.awman/api/<workflow-name>-<content-hash8>.state.json
```

When a work item or issue is given, the state file is saved to:

```
$GITROOT/.awman/workflows/<repo-hash8>-<work-item>-<workflow-name>.json
```

**Flags accepted by `exec workflow`:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--work-item <N>` / `-w <N>` | Work item number; enables template variable substitution |
| `--issue <ref>` | GitHub issue number, URL, or `owner/repo#N`; mutually exclusive with `--work-item` |
| `--non-interactive` / `-n` | Run each step's agent in print/batch mode |
| `--plan` | Read-only mode for all steps |
| `--allow-docker` | Mount host Docker socket into each step's container |
| `--worktree` | Run all steps in an isolated Git worktree |
| `--overlay=<SPEC>` | Apply overlay(s) to every step; see [Overlays](08-overlays.md) |
| `--auto` | Auto-approve file edits; prompt before shell commands |
| `--yolo` | Fully autonomous mode; implies `--worktree`; auto-advances stuck steps |
| `--agent=<name>` | Default agent for steps that do not specify an `Agent:` field |
| `--model=<NAME>` | Default model for steps that do not specify a `Model:` field |

All workflow flags are described in [Workflows](05-workflows.md#flags).

---

## Non-interactive (headless) operation

Both `exec` and the API server run **non-interactively** — without expecting input from a terminal. There are no interactive prompts, dialogs, or pauses for confirmation; the agent runs from start to finish and you observe the result through stdout/stderr or the event stream. This is what makes awman safe to drive from CI/CD pipelines, cron jobs, and scripts.

### Automatic TTY detection

For the one-shot CLI (`awman chat`, `exec prompt`, `exec workflow`), awman checks whether stdin is connected to a terminal and switches to non-interactive mode automatically when it is not:

```sh
# Interactive (TTY detected)
awman chat

# Non-interactive (stdin redirected from a pipe or file)
awman chat < /dev/null

# Non-interactive (explicit flag, even when a TTY is present)
awman chat --non-interactive
```

When a TTY is present and `--non-interactive` is not passed, awman allows interactive features — full-screen agent sessions, PTY passthrough, and terminal resize (SIGWINCH) forwarding. When no TTY is detected, the agent runs in print/batch mode and awman makes no attempt to manage the terminal.

The API server (`awman api start`) is **always** non-interactive, regardless of the server process's stdin: clients drive it over HTTP and receive updates through the event stream, so there is no terminal to manage.

### Parallel agents in interactive CLI mode

`exec workflow` can run more than one step at once when the workflow's steps are independent (see [Parallel workflows](05-workflows.md#parallel-workflows)). In command mode, running multiple agents at once with a real terminal attached would normally mean several containers writing to your terminal at the same time. Instead, when stdout is a TTY and more than one step is running, awman activates a lightweight status chrome:

- The bottom row of the terminal is reserved for a status line: `[N agents running | showing: <step_name> | Ctrl-S: switch]`
- The rest of the terminal shows the output of whichever step is currently "showing" (the **focused** step)
- Press **Ctrl-S** to cycle the focused step; the display switches to that step's output and the status line updates
- A stuck focused step (no output for 30 seconds) gets a `⚠` prefix on its name in the status line

This chrome is deliberately minimal — a single reserved status row, not a full UI — and only appears when there is something to arbitrate between. With a single running step, or when stdout is not a TTY (redirected to a file, piped, or `--non-interactive`), awman falls back to plain sequential passthrough exactly as described above. In that non-interactive case, if a workflow launches more than one step in parallel, awman prints a warning that step output will interleave without any chrome to separate it, since there is no terminal to reserve a status row on.

### The `--non-interactive` / `-n` flag

Force non-interactive mode even when a TTY is available. Useful for:

- Testing how a workflow behaves headlessly without leaving your terminal.
- Scripting awman commands inside a shell script you happen to be running interactively.
- Environments with a quirky terminal where TTY detection is unreliable.

### Yolo mode in headless contexts

`--yolo` works seamlessly without a terminal, and its stuck-detection keeps unattended runs from stalling:

1. **Stuck detection** runs continuously — the engine tracks output on stdout and stderr.
2. **Auto-advance after 30 seconds of silence** — a 60-second countdown begins when no output is seen.
3. **Countdown via stderr/logs** — progress is printed to stderr (one message every 10 seconds to avoid noise).
4. **Auto-advance when the countdown expires** — the step advances with no user input.

```sh
# CI: no explicit --non-interactive needed; awman detects the headless context
awman exec workflow aspec/workflows/feature-impl.toml --work-item 0042 --yolo
```

The API applies the same `yolo` auto-advance behavior as the CLI.

### Error handling and exit codes

When something fails in a non-interactive run, awman:

1. **Prints error details to stderr** — step name, error code, and any container output.
2. **Exits non-zero** — so CI/CD detects the failure and stops the pipeline.
3. **Does not attempt interactive recovery** — no retry prompts, no manual intervention.

This makes results easy to integrate: check the exit code and act on it. All output goes to stdout (step output, status messages) and stderr (errors, yolo countdown), so you can capture and redirect freely:

```sh
awman exec workflow workflow.toml --yolo > workflow.log 2>&1
```

### Terminal-dependent agents

An agent that needs full-screen terminal control (e.g. an interactive editor) requires a real TTY and cannot run headlessly. Either refactor the workflow to avoid full-screen features, run it on a machine with a terminal, or provide a virtual TTY (tmux/screen) inside the container — rarely needed.

## Starting the server

### Foreground

```sh
awman api start --port 9876 --workdirs /path/to/repo
```

The server starts on the specified port (default `9876`) and accepts requests for the life of the process. The first start auto-generates an API key and prints it in a banner — copy it then; it isn't shown again. Subsequent starts reuse the same hash silently. By default the server speaks HTTPS on a self-signed cert; pass `--dangerously-skip-tls` to fall back to plain HTTP for trusted-local use. Logs are emitted to stderr (color-coded when stderr is a TTY); press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

```sh
# Multiple working directories
awman api start --workdirs /repo-a --workdirs /repo-b

# Custom port
awman api start --port 8080 --workdirs /repo

# Rotate the API key and print the new one to stdout (does not start the server)
awman api start --refresh-key --port 9876 --workdirs /repo

# Plain HTTP on loopback for tests/dev (WARNING: no TLS)
awman api start --dangerously-skip-tls --port 9876 --workdirs /repo

# Disable authentication for this run (WARNING: anyone reachable can drive the server)
awman api start --dangerously-skip-auth --port 9876 --workdirs /repo
```

`--workdirs` accepts one or more absolute paths (repeat the flag for multiple values). Only working directories on the allowlist can be used to create sessions — requests with any other path are rejected with HTTP 403. See [Working directory allowlist](#working-directory-allowlist).

**Start flags related to authentication and transport:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--refresh-key` | Generate a new API key, write its hash to disk, and print the plaintext key. The old key is invalidated immediately. The command exits after printing — it does not start the server. |
| `--dangerously-skip-auth` | Disable authentication for this process lifetime only. The `api_key.hash` file is left untouched; the next normal start re-enables auth using the stored hash. |
| `--dangerously-skip-tls` | Serve plain HTTP on the loopback interface instead of HTTPS. Intended for tests and trusted-local environments only; the server logs a loud warning at startup. Clients must connect with `http://` (not `https://`). |

### Background

```sh
awman api start --background --port 9876 --workdirs /path/to/repo
```

`--background` daemonizes the server using the OS process manager:

| Platform | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| Linux (systemd available) | `systemd-run --user` writes a transient unit |
| macOS (launchd) | Writes `~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.awman.api.plist` and calls `launchctl load` |
| Fallback (no systemd/launchd) | Double-fork; PID written directly |

The PID is stored at `~/.awman/api/awman.pid`. Logs go to `~/.awman/api/awman.log`.

If a server is already running (detected via `awman.pid` and a live process check), `start` prints an error and exits with a non-zero code rather than silently competing for the port.

If `bind()` fails because the port is already in use, the error message includes the port number and the PID holding it (when discoverable):

```
error: port 9876 is already in use (PID 41290)
```

### API server and squad daemon

The API server and the squad daemon share the database and cannot run at the
same time. Starting either one while the other is alive fails before the new
process starts. The error names the other process and its PID, for example:

```
error: the squad daemon is already running (PID 41290). Run `awman squad stop` first; awman api and the squad daemon cannot run at the same time.
```

Stop the running process before starting the other one. See [Squad and
`awman api`](12-squad.md#squad-and-awman-api) for the equivalent instructions
from the squad user's perspective.

---

## Server lifecycle commands

### Status

```sh
awman api status
```

Prints whether the server is running, its PID, port, active session count, and uptime:

```
Status:          running
PID:             81234
Port:            9876
Active sessions: 2
Uptime:          3h 14m
```

If the server is not running:

```
Status:  not running
```

### Logs

```sh
awman api logs
```

Streams `~/.awman/api/awman.log` to stdout in real time (equivalent to `tail -f`). Only available when the server was started with `--background`. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop streaming.

If no log file exists:

```
error: no log file found at ~/.awman/api/awman.log
       start the server with --background to enable file logging
```

#### Session-setup verbosity

While a session is being prepared (`cloning_repository`, `setting_up_branch`, `running_ready`), the server writes the full ready output — including container build lines, git command output, and state transitions — to the API log file. Each line is prefixed with the first 8 characters of the session id so you can grep one session out of a busy log:

```sh
grep '\[a1b2c3d4\]' ~/.awman/api/awman.log
```

To silence this verbose stream, set `AWMAN_API_VERBOSE_SETUP=0` before starting the server. The lines are then emitted at `debug` level and dropped by the default `info` filter; they remain available via `RUST_LOG=debug`.

### Kill

```sh
awman api kill
```

Sends `SIGTERM` to the background server process, allows in-flight requests to drain (up to the graceful shutdown period), and removes the PID file. On macOS, also unloads the launchd plist.

If the server is not running:

```
info: server is not running (no PID file found)
```

---

## Authentication

The API server uses cryptographic API key authentication. Every HTTP request must include the API key; unauthenticated requests are rejected with HTTP 401 before reaching any handler.

### First start — key generation

On the first start (when no `api_key.hash` file exists in `~/.awman/api/`), awman automatically generates a cryptographically random 32-byte key, stores only its SHA-256 hash on disk (never the plaintext), and prints the key to stdout once:

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  awman API key (store this — it will not be shown again)          ║
║  a3f8b2c1...64-character-hex-key...d7e9f0a1                       ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**This is the only time the plaintext key appears.** Store it immediately. Key generation happens before the log file is opened, so the key cannot appear in `awman.log` under any circumstances.

### Subsequent starts

On subsequent starts (when `~/.awman/api/api_key.hash` already exists), the server loads the stored hash silently and starts normally — no banner is printed. The same key continues to work without any client-side changes.

### Rotating the key — `--refresh-key`

To invalidate the current key and generate a new one:

```sh
awman api start --refresh-key --port 9876 --workdirs /repo
```

A new key is generated and its hash replaces the file on disk. The new plaintext key is printed to stdout using the same banner format. All clients using the old key will immediately receive HTTP 401 and must be updated.

### Disabling authentication — `--dangerously-skip-auth`

```sh
awman api start --dangerously-skip-auth --port 9876 --workdirs /repo
```

Skips all authentication checks for this process lifetime. The `api_key.hash` file is not modified; the next normal start re-enables authentication. Use only in isolated, trusted environments (e.g. a local loopback-only setup with strict firewall rules).

### Authenticating requests

Include the API key in every HTTP request using the `Authorization` header:

```sh
# Bearer token format (recommended)
curl -s http://localhost:9876/v1/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>"

# Bare key format (also accepted)
curl -s http://localhost:9876/v1/status \
  -H "Authorization: <your-api-key>"
```

When using `awman remote` subcommands, the key is resolved and injected automatically — see [API key](#api-key-authentication).

**Error responses from the middleware:**

| Situation | HTTP status | Response body |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| No `Authorization` header | 401 | `{"error": "API key required. Pass the key via the Authorization header (e.g. Authorization: Bearer <key>)."}` |
| Wrong key | 401 | `{"error": "Invalid API key."}` |

Hash comparisons use constant-time comparison (`ring::constant_time::verify_slices_are_equal`) to prevent timing attacks.

### Key storage

The key hash is stored at `~/.awman/api/api_key.hash` with mode `0o600` (owner read/write only on Unix). Only the SHA-256 hex digest is written — the plaintext key is never persisted anywhere.

---

## Working directory allowlist

The server maintains a strict allowlist of working directories. Any session creation request that specifies a path not on the allowlist is rejected with HTTP 403.

**At startup**, the allowlist is populated from two sources:

1. `--workdirs` flags passed to `awman api start`
2. `api.workDirs` in the global config (`~/.awman/config.json`)

Both sources are merged. Every path is resolved to its canonical form (symlinks resolved, trailing slashes stripped) via `std::fs::canonicalize`. If a listed path does not exist at startup, a warning is logged but the server still starts — the path stays on the allowlist in case the directory is created later.

To see the current allowlist over HTTP:

```sh
curl http://localhost:9876/v1/workdirs
```

```json
{
  "workdirs": [
    "/home/user/my-project",
    "/home/user/other-project"
  ]
}
```

---

## Job Queue

The API server uses a per-session FIFO queue to serialize command execution. When you submit a command via `POST /v1/commands`, it is enqueued immediately and returns with a `command_id`. A pool of worker tasks processes the queue: each worker claims one queued command at a time and executes it, then claims the next one.

**Key properties:**

- **One command per session at a time**: Within a single session, only one command runs at any moment. Commands are processed in strict FIFO order (ordered by submission time). This ensures workflows don't interfere with each other.

- **Concurrent execution across sessions**: With N worker tasks and M sessions with queued commands, up to min(N, M) commands can run *concurrently* — one per session. For example, with 2 workers and 3 sessions, 2 sessions can execute in parallel while the 3rd waits.

- **Never blocks submission**: Unlike the old behavior, submitting a command never blocks or returns "session busy". The command is enqueued and the request returns immediately with HTTP 202 (if successful) or 409 (if the session is closing). The caller polls `GET /v1/commands/{id}/status` or `GET /v1/sessions/{id}/queue` to check progress.

**Monitoring queue status:**

Use `GET /v1/sessions/{id}/queue` to inspect the queue depth, which command is currently running, and recently completed commands. This is useful for:

- Checking how long commands will take to run (based on queue depth)
- Diagnosing stalls or stuck commands
- Capacity planning (how many workers to run)

**Configuration:**

The number of worker tasks is configurable via the `workers` global config option. The default is 2 workers. See [Server configuration](#server-configuration) below.

---

## HTTP API

All endpoints speak JSON. All requests and responses are logged at `INFO` level or above.

When authentication is enabled (the default), every request must include the API key in the `Authorization` header. See [Authentication](#authentication) for details.

### Base URL

```
https://localhost:<port>/v1        # default (self-signed TLS)
http://localhost:<port>/v1         # only if started with --dangerously-skip-tls
```

The default TLS cert is self-signed (stored at `~/.awman/api/tls/cert.pem`), so HTTP clients will reject it unless you tell them not to. With curl:

```sh
# Easiest: skip verification (acceptable for loopback)
curl -k https://localhost:9876/v1/status -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"

# Stricter: pin the self-signed cert as the only trusted CA
curl --cacert ~/.awman/api/tls/cert.pem https://localhost:9876/v1/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

Every `curl` example in the rest of this document elides `-k`/`--cacert` for brevity; add one of the two flags above to any of them when running against the default HTTPS server.

### Sessions

#### Create a session

There are two types of sessions:

**Local session** — bound to a working directory on the server's filesystem:

```sh
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9876/v1/sessions \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"type":"local","workdir":"/home/user/my-project"}'
```

**Remote session** — clones a git repository on the server and operates within the clone:

```sh
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9876/v1/sessions \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"type":"remote","repo_url":"https://github.com/org/repo","branch":"main"}'
```

Both types return immediately with a session UUID:

```json
{ "session_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890" }
```

**Local sessions** bind to an existing directory on the server. The directory must be in the allowlist (configured via `api.workDirs` in global config or `--workdirs` at startup). Workflows run directly in that directory.

**Remote sessions** clone a git repository into an isolated directory on the server (`~/.awman/sessions/{session_id}/repo/`). Workflows run inside the clone. When the session is closed, the cloned directory is deleted, leaving no artifacts on the server. This is useful for running ephemeral CI jobs where you want to operate on a remote repo without setting up a local copy.

#### End-to-end example: Remote session workflow with setup and teardown

This example demonstrates using a remote session to run an automated feature implementation workflow with setup and teardown steps. The repo is cloned by awman at session creation; setup installs dependencies; the main workflow steps implement the feature; teardown runs tests and creates a pull request.

**1. Create a remote session:**

```sh
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9876/v1/sessions \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "type": "remote",
    "repo_url": "https://github.com/org/my-project",
    "branch": "main"
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{ "session_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890" }
```

At this point, the repository has been cloned on the server and the main branch has been checked out. The session's working directory contains a fresh clone.

**2. Create a workflow file with setup and teardown (saved to your repo as `aspec/workflows/implement-feature.toml`):**

```toml
name = "implement-feature"
teardown_on_failure = true

[[setup]]
type = "checkout_create_branch"
branch = "feature/auto-implementation"
base = "main"

[[setup]]
type = "run_shell"
command = "npm install"

[[setup]]
type = "run_shell"
command = "npm run build"

[[steps]]
name = "implement"
prompt = """
Analyze the following work item and implement the feature:

{{work_item_content}}
"""

[[steps]]
name = "review"
depends_on = ["implement"]
prompt = "Review the implementation for correctness and style."

[[teardown]]
type = "run_shell"
command = "npm test"

[[teardown]]
type = "commit_changes"
message = "feat: implementation from automated workflow"
add_all = true

[[teardown]]
type = "push_branch"
remote = "origin"
branch = "feature/auto-implementation"

[[teardown]]
type = "create_pull_request"
title = "feat: auto-implemented feature"
body = "This PR was automatically generated by an awman workflow."
base = "main"
```

**3. Submit the workflow to the remote session:**

```sh
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9876/v1/commands \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>' \
  -H 'x-awman-session: a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "subcommand": "exec",
    "args": ["workflow", "aspec/workflows/implement-feature.toml", "--work-item", "0053"]
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{ "command_id": "e5f6a7b8-c9d0-e1f2-3456-7890abcdef01" }
```

**4. What happens next:**

The workflow executes in three phases:

1. **Setup phase:** Inside a background container with the cloned repo mounted:
   - Check out a new feature branch from main
   - Run `npm install` to install dependencies
   - Run `npm run build` to build the project

2. **Main phase:** Run the implement and review steps (agent sessions as usual)

3. **Teardown phase:** After main steps complete, inside a new background container:
   - Run the test suite (`npm test`)
   - Commit all changes with a descriptive message
   - Push the feature branch to the remote (`origin`)
   - Create a pull request via the GitHub CLI

If any step fails (including setup), all subsequent steps are skipped. Because `teardown_on_failure = true`, the teardown phase still runs even if the main workflow fails — useful for cleanup or test reports.

**5. Monitor progress:**

```sh
# Check command status
curl -s http://localhost:9876/v1/commands/e5f6a7b8-c9d0-e1f2-3456-7890abcdef01 \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>'

# Stream output live
curl -s http://localhost:9876/v1/commands/e5f6a7b8-c9d0-e1f2-3456-7890abcdef01/logs/stream \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>'
```

**Key observations:**

- The repository provisioning (`clone`, `branch checkout`) is handled automatically by awman's `GitEngine` when the session is created — the setup phase does not need to clone the primary repo.
- Setup and teardown steps run inside isolated containers, ensuring no side effects on the host.
- All environment variables configured for the project (overlays, env vars) are available in setup and teardown containers.
- If the workflow is interrupted and resumed, the entire setup phase re-runs (steps should be idempotent — e.g., use `npm install` which is safe to re-run).
- The `create_pull_request` step requires the `gh` (GitHub CLI) tool to be available in the base container image. Ensure your `Dockerfile.dev` includes it.
- When the session is closed, the cloned directory and all generated artifacts are deleted from the server.

Error responses:

| Situation | HTTP status |
|-----------|-------------|
| `workdir` not in allowlist (local) | 403 — includes `allowed_workdirs` list |
| Invalid `type` field | 400 |
| Missing required fields | 400 |
| Network error cloning repo (remote) | 500 |

#### List sessions

```sh
# All sessions (active and closed)
curl -s http://localhost:9876/v1/sessions \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>'

# Active sessions only
curl -s "http://localhost:9876/v1/sessions?status=active" \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>'
```

The optional `status` query parameter filters by session status. Accepted values: `active`, `closed`. Without the parameter, all sessions are returned.

```json
{
  "sessions": [
    {
      "id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
      "workdir": "/home/user/my-project",
      "status": "active",
      "created_at": "2026-04-20T12:00:00Z",
      "closed_at": null
    },
    {
      "id": "b2c3d4e5-...",
      "workdir": "/home/user/my-project",
      "status": "closed",
      "created_at": "2026-04-19T09:00:00Z",
      "closed_at": "2026-04-19T09:47:13Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Get session detail

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:9876/v1/sessions/<session-id> \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>'
```

Returns the session record. Returns HTTP 404 if the ID does not exist.

#### Close a session

```sh
curl -s -X DELETE http://localhost:9876/v1/sessions/<session-id> \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>'
```

Gracefully closes a session. All queued commands are cancelled immediately, but any currently running command is allowed to finish before the session is marked closed.

**Behavior:**
- **No queued commands:** Session transitions immediately to `closed` status. Returns HTTP 200.
- **Queued commands, no running command:** All queued commands are cancelled. Session transitions immediately to `closed` status. Returns HTTP 200.
- **Running command:** The session transitions to `closing` status, rejecting new submissions. The running command is allowed to finish. Returns HTTP 202 with details:
  ```json
  {
    "session_id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
    "status": "closing",
    "running_command_id": "cmd-456",
    "cancelled_count": 3,
    "message": "Session is closing. Waiting for running command to complete. Poll GET /v1/sessions/{id}/status to monitor."
  }
  ```
  Poll `GET /v1/sessions/{id}/status` to observe the transition to `closed`.

Closed sessions cannot receive new commands. All command records and output files are preserved — no data is deleted. Returns HTTP 404 if the session does not exist.

---

### Commands

Commands are submitted to a session and execute asynchronously. Submit a command and receive a `command_id` immediately; poll the command endpoint to track progress and retrieve output.

#### Submit a command

```sh
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9876/v1/commands \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>' \
  -H 'x-awman-session: <session-id>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"subcommand":"chat"}'
```

Dispatches a subcommand to the session identified by the `x-awman-session` header. The API accepts commands enabled for API use, including squad task and daemon-management commands. `squad attach` is intentionally excluded: attaching owns an interactive PTY and must be run from the CLI or TUI.

For `exec`, the `args` array starts with the exec action (`prompt` or `workflow`/`wf`), followed by any further arguments:

```sh
# exec prompt via API
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9876/v1/commands \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>' \
  -H 'x-awman-session: <session-id>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"subcommand":"exec","args":["prompt","Fix the failing tests","--non-interactive"]}'

# exec workflow via API
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9876/v1/commands \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>' \
  -H 'x-awman-session: <session-id>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"subcommand":"exec","args":["workflow","./aspec/workflows/implement-feature.toml","--work-item","0053"]}'
```

**Workflow files:** For `exec workflow`, the workflow file path is specified as a positional argument relative to the session's working directory (same format as the CLI). The file must exist within the session's working directory and be a valid TOML or YAML workflow definition. Workflow files are never passed as inline JSON — always use file paths.

Returns immediately with a command UUID — the command is **enqueued** and execution is asynchronous:

```json
{
  "command_id": "e5f6a7b8-...",
  "flags_applied": { "yolo": true, "non_interactive": true }
}
```

The command begins executing as soon as a worker claims it from the queue. **At most one command per session runs at any given time** — commands within a session are processed sequentially in FIFO order. If a command is already running, subsequent commands are queued and wait their turn (they do not block the API request).

**`flags_applied`:** Every `POST /v1/commands` response reports the same two API-profile flag defaults, so the behavior isn't a hidden surprise. They only take effect for commands that actually accept the corresponding flag (`chat`, `exec prompt`, `exec workflow`); for other subcommands the field is informational and doesn't change anything.

| Flag | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `non_interactive` | `true`. HTTP workers have no attached terminal, so a command that accepts `--non-interactive` always runs in print/batch mode — this cannot be turned off. |
| `yolo` | `true` by default for a command that accepts `--yolo`. It's a default, not a forced override: if your request's `args` already specifies a value for the flag, yours is kept instead. See [Permission modes](03-agent-sessions.md#permission-modes) for what running with `--yolo` means — auto-approved actions, stuck-step auto-advance, and so on. |

This has always been awman's behavior for commands dispatched through the API; `flags_applied` documents it explicitly rather than leaving it as an undocumented side effect of dispatch.

Error responses:

| Situation | HTTP status | `error` field |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Session not found or closed | 404 | `"session not found"` (includes session UUID) |
| Session is closing (graceful shutdown) | 409 | `"session is closing"` |
| Unknown subcommand | 400 | `"unknown subcommand"` (includes list of valid subcommands) |
| `x-awman-session` header missing | 400 | `"missing x-awman-session header"` |

#### Get command status

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:9876/v1/commands/<command-id> \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>'
```

Returns the current status and metadata for a command:

```json
{
  "id": "e5f6a7b8-...",
  "session_id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
  "subcommand": "exec",
  "args": ["workflow", "deploy.toml"],
  "status": "queued",
  "queued_at": "2026-04-20T12:00:30Z",
  "queue_position": 2,
  "exit_code": null,
  "started_at": null,
  "finished_at": null,
  "log_path": "~/.awman/api/sessions/a1b2c3d4-.../commands/e5f6a7b8-.../output.log"
}
```

| `status` value | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| `queued` | Enqueued; waiting for a worker to claim it |
| `running` | Claimed by a worker; container is executing |
| `done` | Completed with exit code 0 |
| `error` | Completed with a non-zero exit code |
| `cancelled` | Cancelled before execution (e.g. session kill) |

For `new skill --pull-all`, awman attempts every reachable library even when
one pull fails. If any library fails, the command is reported with
`status: "error"` and `exit_code: 1`; successful library pulls are still
processed and reported in the command log.

**Queue-related response fields** (present when `status = 'queued'`):

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `queued_at` | ISO 8601 timestamp when the command was enqueued |
| `queue_position` | 0-indexed position in the session's queue (0 = next to run). `null` when the command is running, done, or cancelled |
| `worker_id` | UUID of the worker task that claimed this command. Only present when `status = 'running'` |

**Result field** (present when `status = 'done'` or `'error'`):

```json
{
  "exit_code": 0,
  "error": null
}
```

**Malformed `args`:** `POST /v1/commands` enqueues the command and returns 202 without validating the flags/positionals in `args` against the target command's catalogue — that check happens once a worker claims the command. If `args` contains a flag the command doesn't declare, or an invalid value for a typed flag (e.g. a non-numeric `--work-item`), the command still reaches `status: "error"` with `exit_code: 1` and a `result.error` describing the problem, for example:

```json
{
  "exit_code": 1,
  "error": "unknown flag 'not-a-real-flag' for command [\"exec\", \"prompt\"]"
}
```

Poll `GET /v1/commands/{id}` (or the log stream) to see this — it is not returned synchronously from the `POST /v1/commands` call.

#### Get command logs

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:9876/v1/commands/<command-id>/logs \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>'
```

Returns the captured output for a command. Stdout and stderr are combined into a single stream in the order they were written. For a running command, returns whatever has been written so far. For a completed command, returns the full output.

```json
{
  "output": "Implementing work item 0057...\n✓ Tests pass\n"
}
```

Output is written incrementally as the subprocess produces it — not buffered in memory.

#### Stream command logs (live)

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:9876/v1/commands/<command-id>/logs/stream \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>'
```

Opens a persistent HTTP response using [Server-Sent Events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events). The server replays any output already written, then tails the log file and sends new lines as they arrive. When the command completes, the server sends a `[awman:done]` sentinel event and closes the response.

**SSE event format:**

```
data: <line of log output>

data: <another line>

data: [awman:done]

```

Each event is terminated by a blank line (standard SSE format). The sentinel `[awman:done]` signals that the command has finished — no more output will follow.

**Shell example — stream and print until done:**

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:9876/v1/commands/<command-id>/logs/stream \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>' \
| while IFS= read -r line; do
    case "$line" in
      "data: [awman:done]") echo "--- done ---"; break ;;
      data:\ *)              echo "${line#data: }" ;;
    esac
  done
```

**Behaviour notes:**

- If the command has already completed when you connect, the server replays the full historical log and sends `[awman:done]` immediately — no output is missed.
- If the client disconnects mid-stream, the command continues executing unaffected.
- If the log file does not yet exist (the command is `pending`), the server waits up to 10 s for it to appear before returning HTTP 404.
- The `Content-Type` response header is `text/event-stream`.
- **Read timeout:** `awman remote exec --follow` uses a 10-minute read timeout per SSE event. Any output from the server resets the timer, so long-running commands that produce incremental output can stream for hours. If the server is completely silent for 10 minutes, the client disconnects with a timeout message; the command continues running on the server. When using cURL directly with `--no-buffer`, consider adding `--max-time 0` to disable cURL's own timeout for very long-running commands.

`awman remote exec --follow` uses this endpoint internally. The cURL form above is equivalent and is useful in scripts where the awman binary is unavailable on the client.

#### Get session queue status

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:9876/v1/sessions/<session-id>/queue \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>'
```

Returns the current queue state for a session — how many commands are queued, which one is running, and recently completed commands.

```json
{
  "session_id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
  "queue_depth": 3,
  "running": {
    "command_id": "cmd-456",
    "subcommand": "exec",
    "args": ["workflow", "deploy.toml"],
    "started_at": "2026-04-20T12:05:00Z",
    "worker_id": "worker-789"
  },
  "queued": [
    {
      "command_id": "cmd-457",
      "subcommand": "exec",
      "args": ["workflow", "test.toml"],
      "queued_at": "2026-04-20T12:01:00Z",
      "position": 0
    },
    {
      "command_id": "cmd-458",
      "subcommand": "exec",
      "args": ["prompt", "review the code"],
      "queued_at": "2026-04-20T12:02:00Z",
      "position": 1
    }
  ],
  "recent_completed": [
    {
      "command_id": "cmd-455",
      "subcommand": "exec",
      "args": ["workflow", "setup.toml"],
      "status": "done",
      "exit_code": 0,
      "finished_at": "2026-04-20T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response fields:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `session_id` | The session UUID |
| `queue_depth` | Total number of enqueued (not yet running) commands |
| `running` | The currently executing command, or `null` if none |
| `queued` | Array of enqueued commands, in FIFO order, with 0-indexed position |
| `recent_completed` | Array of the 10 most recent completed commands (status `done` or `error`), newest first |

This endpoint is useful for monitoring queue depth and diagnosing stalls in multi-command workflows.

---

### Server health

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:9876/v1/status \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>'
```

```json
{
  "uptime_seconds": 11640,
  "active_sessions": 2,
  "running_commands": 1
}
```

---

### Workflow state

When a command runs a workflow (`exec workflow`), the API server writes a `workflow.state.json` file to the per-command directory. This file is updated atomically on every step transition. The `GET /v1/workflows/:command_id` endpoint exposes that state over HTTP.

#### Get workflow state

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:9876/v1/workflows/<command-id> \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>'
```

Returns the current `WorkflowState` for the given command. The structure is identical to the local workflow state format produced by `awman exec workflow` when it writes state to `$GITROOT/.awman/workflows/`.

```json
{
  "steps": [
    { "name": "plan",      "status": "done"    },
    { "name": "implement", "status": "running" },
    { "name": "docs",      "status": "pending" },
    { "name": "review",    "status": "pending" }
  ],
  "status": "running"
}
```

Use the `status` field in the response body to determine completion — do not rely solely on the HTTP status code.

| `status` value | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| `running` | At least one step is actively executing |
| `paused` | A step is waiting for user confirmation to advance |
| `complete` | All steps finished successfully |
| `error` | At least one step failed |

**Response codes:**

| HTTP status | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| 200 | Workflow state found; body contains the full `WorkflowState` JSON |
| 404 `{"error": "command not found"}` | No command with that ID exists |
| 404 `{"error": "no workflow for this command"}` | The command exists but did not run a workflow (e.g. `exec prompt` or `chat`) |
| 401 | Missing or invalid API key (same auth middleware as all other endpoints) |

**Polling for live workflow progress:**

Poll this endpoint at your preferred interval to track a running workflow. The state file is updated atomically on every step transition, so polls never observe a partial or corrupted state.

```sh
SERVER=http://localhost:9876
KEY=<your-api-key>

# Poll until the workflow reaches a terminal state
while true; do
  RESP=$(curl -s "$SERVER/v1/workflows/$CMD" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY")
  STATUS=$(echo "$RESP" | jq -r '.status')
  echo "Workflow status: $STATUS"
  [ "$STATUS" = "complete" ] || [ "$STATUS" = "error" ] && break
  sleep 5
done
```

If the endpoint returns HTTP 404 on the first poll, the command either has not started yet or is not a workflow command — treat 404 as "no workflow" and skip the Workflow Overview. If 404 is returned after a non-404 response, the workflow was removed; stop polling.

The [Remote-bound TUI tabs](#remote-bound-tui-tabs) feature uses this endpoint internally to render the Workflow Overview for commands running on a remote API server.

## Full example: session lifecycle

```sh
SERVER=http://localhost:9876
KEY=<your-api-key>   # obtained from the startup banner or --refresh-key

# 1. Create a session
SESSION=$(curl -s -X POST "$SERVER/v1/sessions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"workdir":"/home/user/my-project"}' | jq -r .session_id)
echo "Session: $SESSION"

# 2. Submit a command
CMD=$(curl -s -X POST "$SERVER/v1/commands" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  -H "x-awman-session: $SESSION" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"subcommand":"exec","args":["workflow","./aspec/workflows/implement-feature.toml"]}' | jq -r .command_id)
echo "Command: $CMD"

# 3. Poll until done
# Note: The command will first be in 'queued' status while waiting for a worker.
# When a worker claims it, status transitions to 'running', then finally 'done' or 'error'.
while true; do
  RESP=$(curl -s "$SERVER/v1/commands/$CMD" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY")
  STATUS=$(echo "$RESP" | jq -r .status)
  POSITION=$(echo "$RESP" | jq -r '.queue_position // "N/A"')
  echo "Status: $STATUS (queue position: $POSITION)"
  [ "$STATUS" = "done" ] || [ "$STATUS" = "error" ] && break
  sleep 10
done

# 4. Retrieve output
curl -s "$SERVER/v1/commands/$CMD/logs" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" | jq -r .output

# 5. Close the session
curl -s -X DELETE "$SERVER/v1/sessions/$SESSION" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

### Example: one-shot exec prompt

For tasks that don't need a persistent session, `exec prompt` can be run directly from the CLI without starting the HTTP server:

```sh
# Run a single one-shot task; output goes to stdout; exit code reflects agent result
awman exec prompt "Fix the failing tests in src/api" --non-interactive

# Combine with shell tools
awman exec prompt "List all TODO comments in the codebase" --non-interactive | tee todos.txt
```

To drive the same task via the API server (so the result is logged and auditable):

```sh
SERVER=http://localhost:9876
KEY=<your-api-key>

SESSION=$(curl -s -X POST "$SERVER/v1/sessions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"workdir":"/home/user/my-project"}' | jq -r .session_id)

CMD=$(curl -s -X POST "$SERVER/v1/commands" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  -H "x-awman-session: $SESSION" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"subcommand":"exec","args":["prompt","Fix the failing tests","--non-interactive"]}' | jq -r .command_id)

# Poll as usual...
```

---

## Storage layout

API runtime files live under `~/.awman/api/`:

```
~/.awman/api/
  awman.log                        # server log (background mode only)
  awman.pid                        # PID file for the background process
  api_key.hash                     # SHA-256 hex digest of the API key (mode 0600)
  sessions/
    <session-uuid>/
      commands/
        <command-uuid>/
          output.log               # combined stdout+stderr (written incrementally)
          metadata.json            # request payload, timestamps, exit code
          workflow.state.json      # workflow state — only present for workflow commands
```

The shared SQLite database is stored separately at
`~/.awman/data/awman.db`. On the first start after upgrading, awman migrates
the database from its former API storage location automatically. It retains an
`awman.db.pre-migration` backup of the old database; `awman clean` removes that
backup, but never removes the live database.

`workflow.state.json` is written and updated atomically (write to a temp file, then rename) each time the workflow advances to a new step. The file uses the identical JSON structure as the local workflow state in `$GITROOT/.awman/workflows/`. It is created only when the command runs a workflow; it is never present for `exec prompt`, `chat`, or other non-workflow commands.

`awman.db` contains the API session and command records (and the squad task
and run records when squad is in use):

**`sessions`** — one row per session: `id` (UUID), `workdir`, `status` (`active`/`closed`), `created_at`, `closed_at`.

**`commands`** — one row per command: `id` (UUID), `session_id`, `subcommand`, `args` (JSON array), `status` (`queued`/`running`/`done`/`error`/`cancelled`), `exit_code`, `started_at`, `finished_at`, `log_path`, `queued_at` (when enqueued), `worker_id` (UUID of the worker that claimed it), and `result` (JSON object with exit code and error message).

The database is the authoritative record of all activity. The per-command log files hold raw output. Neither is deleted when a session is closed.

`metadata.json` for each command contains the original request payload and precise timestamps:

```json
{
  "id": "e5f6a7b8-...",
  "session_id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
  "subcommand": "implement",
  "args": ["0057"],
  "started_at": "2026-04-20T12:01:00Z",
  "finished_at": "2026-04-20T12:43:17Z",
  "exit_code": 0
}
```

---

## Server configuration

API mode settings live under an `api` key in the global config (`~/.awman/config.json`). All fields are optional.

```json
{
  "api": {
    "workDirs": [
      "/home/user/my-project",
      "/home/user/other-project"
    ],
    "alwaysNonInteractive": true
  }
}
```

### `api.workDirs`

Pre-configure working directories so you don't have to repeat `--workdirs` every time you start the server:

```sh
awman config set --global api.workDirs "/home/user/my-project,/home/user/other-project"
```

Paths from `api.workDirs` and paths from `--workdirs` flags are merged at startup — both sources can be used together. See [Configuration](07-configuration.md#global-config) for the full global config reference.

### `api.alwaysNonInteractive`

When set to `true`, awman automatically injects `--non-interactive` into every dispatched command that supports it — including `implement`, `chat`, `exec prompt`, `exec workflow`, `ready`, and `specs amend`.

```sh
awman config set --global api.alwaysNonInteractive true
```

This is the recommended setting for API server deployments where no TTY is available. It guarantees that no command blocks waiting for interactive input.

When `alwaysNonInteractive` is `true` and a command is dispatched via the HTTP API, the flag is automatically injected into the args vector — you do not need to include `--non-interactive` in your API requests explicitly.

The setting defaults to `false` so that awman's interactive defaults remain unchanged for users who have not configured an API server.

---

## Security

API mode preserves all of awman's container isolation guarantees: every subcommand runs inside a Docker container, never directly on the host.

The HTTP server enforces cryptographic API key authentication on every request by default. The plaintext key is shown once at server start and never logged or persisted; only its SHA-256 hash is stored on disk. See [Authentication](#authentication) for the full key lifecycle.

The working directory allowlist is the secondary access control on the server: even a client that presents a valid API key can only create sessions in pre-approved directories.

For additional defense in depth, bind the server to `localhost` (the default) and restrict external access via firewall rules or SSH tunnels. Even with authentication enabled, reducing the attack surface is always worthwhile.

---

## Session cleanup

At server startup, awman automatically purges sessions that were closed more than 24 hours ago. Their rows are removed from `~/.awman/data/awman.db` along with all associated command records. The on-disk output logs in `~/.awman/api/sessions/<uuid>/` are **not** deleted — they remain for audit purposes.

The cleanup runs once, before the server begins accepting connections. Each purged session is logged at `INFO` level:

```
INFO running stale closed session cleanup
INFO deleted stale session a1b2c3d4-... and 3 linked command records
INFO deleted stale session b2c3d4e5-... and 1 linked command records
```

Sessions closed within the last 24 hours are not touched. The 24-hour boundary (`< datetime('now', '-24 hours')`) is exclusive, so a session closed exactly 24 hours ago is not deleted until the next second boundary passes.

---

## Graceful shutdown

On `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT`, the server finishes all in-flight HTTP responses and allows running commands up to 30 seconds to complete before force-terminating them. Both shutdown start and completion are logged. The 30-second grace period applies whether the server was stopped by `awman api kill` or by sending the signal directly.

---

## API edge cases

| Situation | Behaviour |
|-----------|-----------|
| `workdir` not in allowlist on `POST /v1/sessions` | HTTP 403; response includes the list of allowed directories |
| Session not found or already closed on `POST /v1/commands` | HTTP 404; response includes the session UUID |
| Multiple `POST /v1/commands` in quick succession | All commands are enqueued; first returns immediately, subsequent requests also return immediately with different command IDs; all are processed in FIFO order (one per session at a time) |
| Session is `closing` on `POST /v1/commands` | HTTP 409 `"session is closing"`; command is rejected to prevent new work during graceful shutdown |
| Server already running when `api start` is invoked | Error printed; exits non-zero |
| API server or squad daemon already running when the other is started | Error names the other process and its PID; the new process does not start |
| Port already bound (EADDRINUSE) | Error includes the port number and PID holding it |
| `--workdirs` path doesn't exist at startup | Warning logged; path remains on allowlist |
| `awman api kill` when server is not running | Informational message; exits 0 |
| `awman api logs` with no log file | Clear error suggesting `--background` |
| Unknown `subcommand` in `POST /v1/commands` | HTTP 400; response lists valid subcommands |
| `x-awman-session` header missing | HTTP 400 |
| `exec prompt` with empty string | CLI validation error: `"prompt cannot be empty"` before any container launches |
| `exec workflow` with `{{work_item_content}}` and no `--work-item` | Warning printed; placeholder left unexpanded; workflow continues |
| `exec workflow --work-item <N>` where file not found | Error pointing to the expected path pattern; same message as `implement` |
| `api.alwaysNonInteractive` true + duplicate `--non-interactive` flag in args | Flag is deduplicated; no error |
| `exec` dispatched via HTTP API with unknown action (not `prompt`/`workflow`/`wf`) | HTTP 400; response lists valid exec actions |
| `remote` subcommand dispatched via HTTP API without required args (e.g. no `--session`) | Subprocess exits with a clear error; output appears in the command log |
| No `Authorization` header on any request | HTTP 401 with JSON body explaining which header to use |
| Wrong API key on any request | HTTP 401 with JSON `{"error": "Invalid API key."}` |
| `--refresh-key` used: existing clients present the old key | HTTP 401; clients must be updated with the new key |
| `--dangerously-skip-auth` with a hash file on disk | Auth disabled for this run only; the hash file is not modified; next normal start re-enables auth |
| `api_key.hash` file is missing or unreadable at startup | Server treats it as a first start and generates a new key |
| `GET /v1/sessions?status=active` with no active sessions | Returns `{"sessions":[]}` (empty list); HTTP 200 |
| Session transitions to closed between list fetch and command dispatch | Server enforces rejection at `POST /v1/commands` regardless of filter; client receives HTTP 404 |
| Startup cleanup: sessions closed exactly 24h ago | Not deleted until the next second boundary passes (exclusive `<` comparison) |
| Startup cleanup: on-disk log files for cleaned sessions | Not deleted; they remain in `~/.awman/api/sessions/<uuid>/` for audit purposes |
| `GET /v1/workflows/:command_id` — unknown command ID | HTTP 404 `{"error": "command not found"}` |
| `GET /v1/workflows/:command_id` — command is not a workflow command | HTTP 404 `{"error": "no workflow for this command"}`; `workflow.state.json` is never created |
| `GET /v1/workflows/:command_id` — command is `pending` (not yet started) | HTTP 404 `{"error": "no workflow for this command"}`; file does not exist yet |
| `GET /v1/workflows/:command_id` — workflow is paused | HTTP 200; `WorkflowState.status` is `"paused"`; the paused step is identified in the body; polling may continue since the workflow can resume |
| `GET /v1/workflows/:command_id` — workflow is complete | HTTP 200; `WorkflowState.status` is `"complete"`; all steps present with terminal statuses; clients should stop polling |
| Concurrent reads of `workflow.state.json` during a write | File is written atomically via rename; clients never observe a partial JSON document |
| `DELETE /v1/sessions/:id` — no queued commands, no running command | HTTP 200; session immediately transitions to `closed` status |
| `DELETE /v1/sessions/:id` — queued commands present, no running command | HTTP 200; all queued commands are cancelled; session immediately transitions to `closed` status |
| `DELETE /v1/sessions/:id` — running command present | HTTP 202; session transitions to `closing` status; running command is allowed to finish; client must poll `GET /v1/sessions/:id/status` to observe the transition to `closed` |
| `DELETE /v1/sessions/:id` — called again while `closing` | HTTP 200; returns the current session state (still `closing` if command hasn't finished, or `closed` if it has) |
| `GET /v1/sessions/:id/queue` — session has no commands | HTTP 200; returns `queue_depth: 0`, `running: null`, empty arrays for `queued` and `recent_completed` |
| `GET /v1/sessions/:id/queue` — command is `pending` (queued but not yet claimed) | Appears in the `queued` array with a `position` indicating its place in the queue (0-indexed) |
| `POST /v1/commands` with workflow file that doesn't exist | Command is enqueued; when the worker executes it, it fails with an error in the `result` field and status becomes `error` |
| `POST /v1/commands` with an unknown flag or invalid flag value in `args` | Command is enqueued (202); the flags aren't checked against the command's catalogue until a worker claims it, at which point it fails with `status: "error"`, `exit_code: 1`, and a descriptive `result.error` |

# Remote mode

Remote mode lets you connect to an API awman server running on another machine and run commands there — from your terminal, from a CI pipeline, or from inside the TUI. Live log streaming lets you watch agent output in real time, exactly as if the session were local.

---

## Overview

A typical setup has one machine running `awman api start` (the _remote host_), and one or more developers or pipelines using `awman remote` (the _client_) to dispatch work to it. The remote host manages all sessions and containers. The client only needs the server's address.

```
Local machine                                    Remote host
──────────────                                   ──────────────────────────
awman remote exec workflow my.toml -f ──────────► POST /v1/commands
                                                 ◄── SSE stream: log output
                                                 ◄── [awman:done] sentinel
```

Four subcommands cover the full lifecycle:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `awman remote exec workflow <file>` | Submit a workflow to a session on the remote host |
| `awman remote exec prompt <prompt>` | Send a one-shot prompt to a session on the remote host |
| `awman remote session start [dir]` | Create a new session on the remote host |
| `awman remote session kill [session-id]` | Close a session on the remote host |

All subcommands work from the terminal (CLI mode) and from inside the TUI (where interactive pickers are also available).

---

## Connecting to a remote host

Every `remote` subcommand needs to know the address of the remote API server. The address is resolved in this order:

| Priority | Source |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | `--remote-addr <URL>` flag on the command |
| 2 | `AWMAN_REMOTE_ADDR` environment variable |
| 3 | `remote.defaultAddr` in `~/.awman/config.json` |

If none of the three sources provides an address, the command fails immediately with:

```
error: No remote address configured. Pass --remote-addr, set AWMAN_REMOTE_ADDR,
       or set remote.defaultAddr in ~/.awman/config.json.
```

The most convenient setup for day-to-day use is to set a default address once:

```sh
awman config set --global remote.defaultAddr http://build-server.example.com:9876
```

After that, every `awman remote` command targets that host by default, with no flag required.

---

## API key authentication

When the remote API server has authentication enabled (the default), every request must include the API key. The key is resolved automatically from one of these sources, in priority order:

| Priority | Source |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | `--api-key <KEY>` flag on the command |
| 2 | `AWMAN_API_KEY` environment variable |
| 3 | `remote.defaultAPIKey` in `~/.awman/config.json` — **only when the target address exactly matches `remote.defaultAddr`** |

The host-match guard on `remote.defaultAPIKey` prevents a stored key from being silently forwarded to a different server. If you change `--remote-addr` or `AWMAN_REMOTE_ADDR` to point at a different host, the config key is ignored and the request proceeds without auth — resulting in an HTTP 401 if that server requires a key.

### Storing the key

The recommended approach for day-to-day use is to store the key in global config:

```sh
awman config set --global remote.defaultAPIKey <your-api-key>
```

With both `remote.defaultAddr` and `remote.defaultAPIKey` configured, every `awman remote` command to the default host is fully authenticated with no extra flags.

For CI pipelines, use the environment variable:

```sh
export AWMAN_REMOTE_ADDR=http://build-server.internal:9876
export AWMAN_API_KEY=<your-api-key>

awman remote exec workflow aspec/workflows/implement-feature.toml --follow
```

### Security note

`AWMAN_API_KEY` is visible in `/proc/<pid>/environ` on Linux. In security-sensitive contexts, prefer passing the key via `--api-key` piped from a secrets manager, or store it in `~/.awman/config.json` with restricted file permissions (`chmod 600 ~/.awman/config.json`).

---

## `awman remote exec workflow`

Submits a workflow file to a session on the remote host.

```sh
awman remote exec workflow <file> [--session <ID>] [--follow] [--remote-addr <URL>] [exec workflow flags]
```

Accepts the same flags as `awman exec workflow` (except `--worktree`, which is a server-side concern), plus the remote transport flags below.

### Basic usage

```sh
# Submit a workflow; return a command ID immediately
awman remote exec workflow path/to/workflow.toml --session abc123

# Stream output to your terminal until complete
awman remote exec workflow path/to/workflow.toml --session abc123 --follow

# Short form for --follow
awman remote exec workflow path/to/workflow.toml --session abc123 -f

# Pass exec workflow flags through unchanged
awman remote exec workflow path/to/workflow.toml --yolo --work-item 0042 --session abc123 -f
```

### Flags

| Flag | Short | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `--session <ID>` | | Session ID on the remote host. Required in CLI mode; interactive in TUI mode. Overrides `AWMAN_REMOTE_SESSION` |
| `--follow` | `-f` | Stream log output until the command completes, then print a summary table |
| `--remote-addr <URL>` | | Remote host address. Overrides `AWMAN_REMOTE_ADDR` and `remote.defaultAddr` |
| `--api-key <KEY>` | | API key for the remote server. Overrides `AWMAN_API_KEY` and `remote.defaultAPIKey` |

Plus all `exec workflow` flags (except `--worktree`): `--work-item`, `--yolo`, `--auto`, `--plan`, `--agent`, `--model`, `--overlay`, `--issue`, `-n/--non-interactive`.

### Session resolution

The session is resolved in this order:

| Priority | Source |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | `--session <ID>` flag |
| 2 | `AWMAN_REMOTE_SESSION` environment variable |
| 3 | TUI only — last session used in this tab (not available in CLI) |
| 4 | TUI only — interactive session picker |

In CLI mode, if neither `--session` nor `AWMAN_REMOTE_SESSION` is set, the command fails with:

```
error: No session specified. Pass --session <ID> or set AWMAN_REMOTE_SESSION.
       Use `awman remote session start` to create a session, or list sessions
       with `curl <remote-addr>/v1/sessions`.
```

### Live log streaming (`--follow`)

Without `--follow`, the command submits the workflow and returns immediately with the command ID:

```
Command dispatched: e5f6a7b8-...
```

With `--follow`, awman connects to the SSE log-streaming endpoint and relays output to your terminal in real time:

```
Connecting to log stream for e5f6a7b8-... on http://build-server.example.com:9876...
Implementing work item 0059...
✓ Tests pass
✓ Cargo build successful
...
```

Once the command completes, awman prints a summary table and exits:

```
┌──────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Field        │ Value                                  │
├──────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Command ID   │ e5f6a7b8-…                             │
│ Session ID   │ abc123                                 │
│ Status       │ done                                   │
│ Exit Code    │ 0                                      │
│ Started      │ 2026-04-22T10:00:00Z                   │
│ Finished     │ 2026-04-22T10:02:31Z                   │
└──────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

If the command had already completed before you connected, `--follow` replays the full historical log and then prints the summary immediately — there is no gap or missed output.

When output is piped to a non-terminal, log lines are written without ANSI decoration.

---

## `awman remote exec prompt`

Sends a one-shot prompt to a session on the remote host.

```sh
awman remote exec prompt <prompt> [--session <ID>] [--follow] [--remote-addr <URL>] [exec prompt flags]
```

Accepts the same flags as `awman exec prompt` plus the remote transport flags.

```sh
# Submit a prompt; return a command ID immediately
awman remote exec prompt "Fix the failing tests" --session abc123

# Stream output to your terminal until complete
awman remote exec prompt "Fix the failing tests" --session abc123 --follow

# Pass exec prompt flags through
awman remote exec prompt "Fix the tests" --yolo --agent claude --session abc123 -f
```

Session resolution and `--follow` behavior are identical to `remote exec workflow`.

---

## `awman remote session start`

Creates a new session on the remote host.

```sh
awman remote session start [dir] [--remote-addr <URL>] [--api-key <KEY>]
```

`dir` is the absolute path (on the remote host) of the working directory for the session. It must be in the remote host's `--workdirs` allowlist.

```sh
# Start a session bound to /home/user/my-project
awman remote session start /home/user/my-project

# Specify a non-default remote host and key
awman remote session start /home/user/my-project \
  --remote-addr http://alt-host:9876 \
  --api-key <key>
```

On success, awman prints the new session ID:

```
Session started: a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
Workdir: /home/user/my-project
```

In CLI mode, `dir` is required. In TUI mode, `dir` is optional — if omitted and saved directories are configured, awman shows an interactive picker (see [TUI interactive flows](#tui-interactive-flows)).

---

## `awman remote session kill`

Closes a session on the remote host.

```sh
awman remote session kill [session-id] [--remote-addr <URL>] [--api-key <KEY>]
```

```sh
# Kill a specific session
awman remote session kill a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890

# Specify a non-default remote host and key
awman remote session kill abc123 \
  --remote-addr http://alt-host:9876 \
  --api-key <key>
```

On success:

```
Session closed: a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
```

In CLI mode, `session-id` is required. In TUI mode, if omitted, awman fetches the active session list from the remote host and shows an interactive picker.

---

## TUI interactive flows

When used inside the awman TUI, `remote` subcommands gain interactive capabilities that are not available in CLI mode.

### Session picker (`remote exec` without `--session`)

If you run `remote exec workflow` or `remote exec prompt` in the TUI without specifying a session, and no session is stored from previous activity in the current tab, awman fetches the **active** session list from the remote host (using `GET /v1/sessions?status=active`) and displays an interactive picker. Closed sessions are never shown in the picker.

The picker dialog has a dynamic width that adjusts to fit long session IDs and working directory paths. Session IDs are truncated with `…` if necessary to preserve the full workdir path — the part most useful for identification.

```
╭─── Select Session ───────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│                                                                    │
│   ▶  a1b2c3d4  /home/user/my-project                              │
│      b2c3d4e5  /home/user/other-project                           │
│                                                                    │
│  ↑↓ navigate  Enter confirm  Esc cancel                            │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

Use `↑` / `↓` to highlight a session and `Enter` to confirm. The TUI remembers your choice for the rest of the tab's lifetime — subsequent `remote exec` commands in the same tab skip the picker and use the remembered session automatically.

If the remote host has no active sessions, the picker displays:

```
No active sessions on http://build-server.example.com:9876. Run `remote session start` first.
```

### Saved-dir picker (`remote session start` without a directory)

If you run `remote session start` in the TUI without a directory argument, and `remote.savedDirs` is configured, awman shows a directory picker:

```
╭─── Select Directory ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│                                                                              │
│   ▶  /home/user/my-project                                                   │
│      /home/user/other-project                                                │
│      /opt/builds/service-a                                                   │
│                                                                              │
│  ↑↓ navigate  Enter confirm  Esc cancel                                      │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

If no saved directories are configured and no directory argument is given:

```
error: No directory specified and no savedDirs configured.
       Pass a directory argument or add paths via: config set remote.savedDirs --global
```

### Save-dir prompt (`remote session start` with a new directory)

When you start a session with a directory that is not in `remote.savedDirs`, the TUI offers to save it:

```
╭────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  Save '/home/user/new-project' to remote.savedDirs? (y/n)      │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

- `y` — saves the path to `remote.savedDirs` in your global config, then starts the session
- `n` or `Enter` — starts the session without saving
- `Esc` — cancels the session start entirely

### Session kill picker (`remote session kill` without a session ID)

If you run `remote session kill` in the TUI without a session ID, awman fetches the active session list (`?status=active`) and shows a picker titled "Kill Session". Closed sessions are not listed. Navigation is identical to the session picker above.

## Remote-bound TUI tabs

When `remote.defaultAddr` is configured in `~/.awman/config.json`, the TUI's **new-tab dialog** (opened with **Ctrl+T**) can permanently bind a new tab to a remote API session. Every command typed in a remote-bound tab is forwarded to the remote host via the API — no `remote exec` prefix or `--session` flag required.

### Creating a remote-bound tab

Press **Ctrl+T**. When `remote.defaultAddr` is configured, awman asynchronously fetches the list of active sessions from the remote host and displays them below the working directory field:

```
┌──── New Tab ─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Working directory:                                       │
│  [ /workspace/myproject                               ]   │
│                                                           │
│  ─── Remote sessions (1.2.3.4:9876) ───────────────────  │
│    abc123  /workspace/proj-a                              │
│  > def456  /workspace/proj-b          ← selected         │
│    + Create new remote session                            │
│                                                           │
│  [Enter] confirm  [Esc] cancel  [↓] move to remote list  │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

While the fetch is in-flight, the list area shows `"  Loading remote sessions…"`. The dialog does not block — you can open a local tab immediately by pressing **Enter** in the workdir field if the remote host is slow to respond.

Only **active** sessions are shown; closed sessions are excluded.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **↓** (workdir field focused) | Move focus to the remote session list |
| **↑ / ↓** (list focused) | Navigate the session list |
| **↑** (top of list, list focused) | Return focus to the workdir field |
| **Enter** (workdir field focused) | Open a local tab with that working directory — unchanged behavior |
| **Enter** (session selected) | Create a new tab permanently bound to that remote session |
| **Enter** (`+ Create new remote session` selected) | Open the create-session sub-modal |
| **Esc** | Cancel the entire modal |

**Fetch failure messages** (non-fatal — a local tab can still be opened):

| Situation | Message shown |
|-----------|---------------|
| Remote host unreachable | `"  ⚠ Could not reach <host>: <error>"` |
| Auth required but no key configured | `"  ⚠ Auth required for <host>. Set remote.defaultAPIKey or pass --api-key."` |

### Creating a new remote session from the dialog

Selecting **"+ Create new remote session"** transitions the dialog to a session-creation sub-modal:

```
┌──── New Remote Session ──────────────────────────────────┐
│  Remote working directory:                                │
│  [ /workspace/                                        ]   │
│                                                           │
│  Saved directories:                                       │
│    /workspace/proj-a                                      │
│  > /workspace/proj-b          ← selected                 │
│                                                           │
│  [Enter] confirm  [Esc] back  [↑↓] navigate saved dirs   │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Entries from `remote.savedDirs` appear in the list. Selecting one populates the text field at the top. Press **Enter** to create the session on the remote host and open a tab bound to it. Press **Esc** to return to the new-tab dialog.

If session creation fails (e.g. the directory is not in the server's allowlist), the modal shows the error text. Press **Esc** to close and press **Ctrl+T** to start over.

### Remote-bound tab appearance

Remote-bound tabs are **purple** in the tab bar. The tab label shows the `host:port` of the remote host (the `display_host`, extracted from `remote.defaultAddr` at binding time) instead of the local working directory short name.

```
┌─ Tab 1: myproject ──────────┬─ 1.2.3.4:9876 ─────────────┐
│  exec workflow plan.md       │  exec workflow build.md     │
└──────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────┘
```

The `display_host` label is fixed for the lifetime of the tab — it does not change if `remote.defaultAddr` is later modified in config. The inner subtitle (below the hostname) shows the command currently running on the remote session, or `(ready)` when idle.

### Command execution in a remote-bound tab

Every command typed in a remote-bound tab is sent to the remote session via `POST /v1/commands`, then output is streamed back in real time via the SSE log-streaming endpoint — identical to `remote exec workflow <file> --follow` but with no flags required. The tab transitions through the same execution phase states as a local tab (running → done / error).

When first created, the tab automatically dispatches a `ready` command to the remote session (matching local tab behavior). The `ready` output appears in the execution window.

If the remote host returns an error (auth failure, session not found, network error), the error appears in the execution window. The tab remains bound to the remote session and accepts subsequent commands normally — the binding is permanent for the lifetime of the tab.

Flags that refer to remote addressing (`--session`, `--remote-addr`, `--api-key`) are stripped from forwarded commands, since the binding already supplies the target.

### Closing a remote-bound tab

Closing a remote-bound tab (with **Ctrl+C** when multiple tabs are open) cancels any in-flight command stream and any active workflow polling task. The remote session itself is **not** closed — it continues running on the remote host and can be accessed again later via a new remote-bound tab or the `remote` CLI subcommands.

### Workflow Overview for remote-bound tabs

When a workflow command is dispatched from a remote-bound tab (`exec workflow`), the Workflow Overview appears automatically — exactly as it does for local workflow runs.

Starting 5 seconds after the command is dispatched, awman polls `GET /v1/workflows/:command_id` on the remote API server every 5 seconds. As soon as a workflow state is found, the overview renders and continues updating until the workflow reaches a terminal state (`complete` or `error`).

The remote Workflow Overview is visually identical to the local one: parallel steps, paused states, running steps, and completion markers all render the same way, and **Ctrl-O** minimizes / maximizes it just as it does locally. No extra configuration is required.

**Polling behavior:**

| Situation | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| No workflow found (HTTP 404) on first poll | Polling stops silently — the command is not a workflow command |
| No workflow found (HTTP 404) after a previous 200 | Polling stops — workflow state was removed |
| Transient network error during polling | Retried on the next 5-second interval; no error shown to the user |
| Workflow reaches `complete` or `error` | Polling stops; the overview reflects the final state |
| Tab closed while polling | Poll task cancelled immediately |
| New command dispatched from the same tab | Previous poll task cancelled; new poll task starts for the new command |

---

## Remote client configuration

Remote mode settings live under a `remote` key in the global config (`~/.awman/config.json`). All fields are optional.

```json
{
  "remote": {
    "defaultAddr": "http://build-server.example.com:9876",
    "defaultAPIKey": "<64-character hex API key>",
    "savedDirs": [
      "/home/user/my-project",
      "/home/user/other-project"
    ]
  }
}
```

### `remote.defaultAddr`

The default address of the remote API awman server. When set, you don't need to pass `--remote-addr` on every command.

```sh
awman config set --global remote.defaultAddr http://build-server.example.com:9876
```

Overridden per-invocation by `--remote-addr` or `AWMAN_REMOTE_ADDR`.

### `remote.defaultAPIKey`

The default API key to send when authenticating to the remote API server. When set alongside `remote.defaultAddr`, every `awman remote` command to that host is authenticated automatically with no extra flags.

```sh
awman config set --global remote.defaultAPIKey <your-api-key>
```

**Security constraint:** this key is **only sent when the target address exactly matches `remote.defaultAddr`** (scheme, host, and port, after stripping trailing slashes). If you use `--remote-addr` or `AWMAN_REMOTE_ADDR` to point at a different server, the stored key is ignored — it is never silently forwarded to an unintended host.

Overridden per-invocation by `--api-key` or `AWMAN_API_KEY`.

### `remote.savedDirs`

A list of working directory paths (absolute paths on the remote host) for use by the TUI's saved-dir picker when running `remote session start` without a directory argument.

```sh
# Set a single directory
awman config set --global remote.savedDirs /home/user/my-project

# Set multiple directories (comma-separated)
awman config set --global remote.savedDirs "/home/user/my-project,/home/user/other-project"

# Clear all saved directories
awman config set --global remote.savedDirs ""
```

Directories can also be added interactively from the TUI: when you start a session with a directory not already in the list, the TUI offers to save it for you.

---

## Full example: end-to-end CLI workflow

```sh
# Configure the remote host and API key once
awman config set --global remote.defaultAddr http://build-server.example.com:9876
awman config set --global remote.defaultAPIKey <your-api-key>

# Create a session on the remote host
SESSION=$(awman remote session start /home/user/my-project | grep 'Session started:' | awk '{print $NF}')
echo "Session: $SESSION"

# Dispatch a workflow and stream its output
awman remote exec workflow path/to/workflow.toml --session "$SESSION" --follow

# Or pipe into a log file (no ANSI decoration)
awman remote exec workflow path/to/workflow.toml --session "$SESSION" --follow > workflow.log

# Kill the session when you are done
awman remote session kill "$SESSION"
```

---

## Full example: CI pipeline

```sh
export AWMAN_REMOTE_ADDR=http://build-server.internal:9876
export AWMAN_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
export AWMAN_REMOTE_SESSION=<pre-provisioned-session-id>

# Dispatch the workflow; exit code reflects the command's exit code
awman remote exec workflow path/to/workflow.toml --follow
```

For CI contexts where a session is long-lived and pre-provisioned, setting `AWMAN_REMOTE_SESSION` and `AWMAN_API_KEY` in the pipeline environment avoids per-command flags entirely.

---

## Using cURL directly

Because `remote exec` is built on the API HTTP API, you can use cURL (or any HTTP client) wherever `awman remote` is inconvenient — for example, in scripts with no awman binary available:

```sh
SERVER=http://build-server.example.com:9876
KEY=<your-api-key>
SESSION=a1b2c3d4-...

# Submit a command
CMD=$(curl -s -X POST "$SERVER/v1/commands" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  -H "x-awman-session: $SESSION" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"subcommand":"exec","args":["workflow","path/to/workflow.toml"]}' | jq -r .command_id)

# Stream live output via SSE (prints each log line as it arrives)
curl -s "$SERVER/v1/commands/$CMD/logs/stream" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
| while IFS= read -r line; do
  case "$line" in
    "data: [awman:done]") echo "--- done ---"; break ;;
    data:\ *)             echo "${line#data: }" ;;
  esac
done

# Or poll until done, then fetch the full log
while true; do
  STATUS=$(curl -s "$SERVER/v1/commands/$CMD" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" | jq -r .status)
  [ "$STATUS" = "done" ] || [ "$STATUS" = "error" ] && break
  sleep 5
done
curl -s "$SERVER/v1/commands/$CMD/logs" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" | jq -r .output
```

See [API mode](#api-mode) for the full HTTP API reference, including session management endpoints.

## Remote edge cases

| Situation | Behaviour |
|-----------|-----------|
| No remote address configured | Error with instructions to pass `--remote-addr`, set `AWMAN_REMOTE_ADDR`, or configure `remote.defaultAddr` |
| `remote exec` without `--session` in CLI mode | Error with instructions to pass `--session` or set `AWMAN_REMOTE_SESSION` |
| `remote session start` without a directory in CLI mode | Error with instructions to pass a directory argument |
| `remote session kill` without a session ID in CLI mode | Error with instructions to pass a session ID |
| Session not found on remote | HTTP 404 from the server; error message includes the session ID and suggests `remote session start` |
| Remote host unreachable | Connection timeout after 10 s; error message includes the target address |
| Session is busy (command already running) | HTTP 403 from the server; error message includes the running command ID |
| `--follow` on a command that already completed | Full historical log is replayed, then summary is printed — no output is missed |
| `--follow` command runs longer than 10 minutes with no output | Client times out and prints: `"Request to <addr> timed out after 10 minutes. The remote command may still be running on the server."` The command continues running on the server; reconnect with `remote exec` (without `--follow`) to check status |
| `--follow` receives any output from server within 10 minutes | Timeout is reset on each received event; commands that produce incremental output can run for hours |
| `remote session start` with a new dir (TUI) | Offers to save the path to `remote.savedDirs`; session starts regardless of whether you save |
| TUI session picker: remote host has no active sessions | Picker modal shows "No active sessions" message; `Enter` and `Esc` both cancel |
| TUI session picker: fetch fails | Error shown in command input bar; no modal opens |
| TUI `remote session start` with no saved dirs and no dir argument | Error in command input bar: "No directory specified and no savedDirs configured" |
| `remote session start` with a dir already in `savedDirs` | Dir is not duplicated in the list when the save-dir prompt is accepted |
| Inner command flags (e.g. `--yolo`) | Forwarded to the remote host verbatim; not consumed by the `remote exec` parser |
| No API key provided and server requires auth | HTTP 401; error body explains which header to use |
| `remote.defaultAPIKey` set but target address differs from `remote.defaultAddr` | Config key is ignored; request proceeds without auth (server returns 401 if auth is required) |
| `remote.defaultAPIKey` matches `remote.defaultAddr` with trailing slash difference | Trailing slashes are stripped from both sides before comparison; key is used |
| Session closed between picker fetch and command dispatch | Server returns HTTP 404; client surfaces a clear error; session is not re-opened |
| **Ctrl+T** with `remote.defaultAddr` not configured | New-tab dialog behaves exactly as before — no remote session list, no fetch, no binding option |
| **Ctrl+T** opened while a previous remote session fetch is still in-flight | Previous fetch is cancelled; new fetch starts for the fresh modal open |
| Remote-bound tab: auth error when dispatching a command | Error appears in the execution window; no `command_id` returned; workflow polling does not start; tab stays bound |
| Remote-bound tab: remote session closed externally while tab is open | `POST /v1/commands` returns HTTP 404; error shown in execution window; subsequent commands also fail until the session is recreated on the remote host |
| Remote-bound tab: command contains `--session` or `--remote-addr` flags | These flags are stripped before forwarding; the tab's binding supplies the target |
| Remote-bound tab: tab closed while a command stream is in-flight | SSE stream task and any workflow poll task are cancelled; the remote command continues executing on the server |
| Remote-bound tab: new command dispatched while workflow polling is active | Previous poll task cancelled; new poll task starts 5 seconds after the new command is dispatched |
| Remote-bound tab: create-new-session sub-modal — remote dir creation fails | Modal shows error text; no tab created; press **Esc** and retry with **Ctrl+T** |
| Remote Workflow Overview: `GET /v1/workflows/:command_id` returns HTTP 404 | Polling stops silently; no error shown; the overview does not appear |
| Remote Workflow Overview: transient network errors during polling | Retried on next 5-second interval; not surfaced to user |
| Remote Workflow Overview: parallel steps | Rendered stacked in the overview, identical to local workflow parallel steps |
| Remote Workflow Overview: paused step | The overview shows the paused indicator on the paused step; polling continues since the workflow may resume |
