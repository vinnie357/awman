#
# Question: can `security add-generic-password` take the secret on stdin
# instead of as a `-w <value>` argument? Argv is visible to the same user via
# `ps`, so if the answer is no, the macOS `KeychainStore` backend is dropped
# rather than shipping a design that leaks the secret it exists to protect.
#
# Four tests:
#   1. `-w` with no value, secret piped   — does it read stdin or /dev/tty?
#   2. `security -i`                       — plan B: the whole command line on
#                                            stdin, so the value never enters
#                                            any process's argv.
#   3. both of the above under launchd     — no controlling terminal at all,
#                                            which is the daemon's real case.
#   4. the actual payload shape            — a base64-wrapped JSON map, in both
#                                            contexts, at a realistic size.
#
# A GUI authorization dialog during test 3 is a FAIL even on exit 0: an
# unattended daemon has nobody to answer it.
#
# MEASURED RESULT (2026-09-08, macOS) — the answer is `security -i`:
#   Test 1  FAIL. From a terminal, `security ... -w` ignores the pipe, opens
#           /dev/tty and prompts there.
#   Test 2  PASS. `security -i` wrote and read back the sentinel.
#   Test 3  Under launchd (no tty) the piped form behaves differently again:
#           it reads stdin, demands the value twice, hits EOF on the confirm,
#           reports "passwords don't match" — and still exits 0 having stored
#           nothing. `security -i` passed, with no prompt of any kind and no
#           GUI authorization dialog.
#   Test 4  PASS in both contexts. A 589-byte JSON map containing " \ $ ` ; |
#           & and spaces, base64-wrapped in the go-keyring-base64: envelope,
#           round-tripped byte-identical through `security -i` as an 806-byte
#           item — from a terminal and from the launchd job alike. The envelope
#           is what makes this safe: `security -i` parses stdin as command
#           lines, and base64's alphabet passes that parser untouched.
# Corollary: the item's trusted application is /usr/bin/security, not awman,
# so rebuilding awman does not invalidate ACL trust.
# Consequences are written up in work item 0116 §5. Re-run this probe if a
# macOS release changes `security`'s behaviour.
#
# Self-cleaning: removes the keychain item and the plist it creates.
