# CLI Design

Binary name: `awman`
Install path: `/usr/local/bin/`
Storage location: `$HOME/.awman/`

This document is the authoritative specification of the `awman` CLI surface. It is regenerated from `CommandCatalogue` (see `src/command/dispatch/catalogue.rs`); when you change a command, subcommand, flag, or alias, update this file. CI does not block on drift today, but every reviewer should treat divergence between this file and the catalogue as a defect.

## Design principles

- **Single binary, two modes.** `awman` with no arguments launches a Ratatui TUI. `awman <subcommand> …` runs a single command and exits, with output on stdout/stderr.
- **Catalogue-driven.** Every flag, subcommand, and default lives in `CommandCatalogue`. Frontends read from the catalogue rather than hard-coding strings.
- **Non-interactive by default for scripts.** Flags like `--non-interactive` and `--json` are first-class for API and CI use. `--json` always implies `--non-interactive`.
- **Container isolation.** Every agentic operation runs inside a Docker (or Apple Containers) container built from `Dockerfile.dev`. The host never executes agent code directly.

## Top-level commands

| Command | Summary |
|---|---|
| `awman` | Launch the interactive TUI. |
| `awman init` | Initialize the current Git repo for use with awman. |
| `awman ready` | Verify the Docker daemon, ensure `Dockerfile.dev`, build the dev image. |
| `awman chat` | Freeform chat session with the configured agent. |
| `awman specs <subcommand>` | Manage work item specs. |
| `awman new <subcommand>` | Create a new awman artefact (spec, workflow, skill). |
| `awman exec <subcommand>` | Run a one-shot prompt or workflow. |
| `awman config <subcommand>` | View and edit global/repo configuration. |
| `awman status` | Show all running awman containers. |
| `awman api <subcommand>` | Run awman as an API HTTP server. |
| `awman squad <subcommand>` | Manage the squad task daemon and scheduled tasks. |
| `awman remote <subcommand>` | Connect to a remote API instance. |

### Top-level flags (apply before any subcommand)

| Flag | Kind | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--build` | bool | false | Force rebuild of images on startup. |
| `--no-cache` | bool | false | Disable Docker layer cache during builds. |
| `--refresh` | bool | false | Refresh agent environment (run audit). |
| `-h, --help` | bool | — | Print help. |
| `-V, --version` | bool | — | Print version. |

## Per-command surface

### `awman init`

Initialize the current Git repo for use with awman.

| Flag | Kind | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--agent <name>` | enum | `claude` | One of: `claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, `maki`, `gemini`, `copilot`, `crush`, `cline`. |
| `--aspec` | bool | false | Download aspec templates into the project. |

### `awman ready`

| Flag | Kind | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--refresh` | bool | false | Run the Dockerfile agent audit. |
| `--build` | bool | false | Force rebuild of the dev image. |
| `--no-cache` | bool | false | Pass `--no-cache` to `docker build`. |
| `-n, --non-interactive` | bool | false | Run the agent in non-interactive (print) mode. |
| `--allow-docker` | bool | false | Mount the host Docker daemon socket into the agent container. |
| `--json` | bool | false | Suppress human output and print structured JSON. **Implies `--non-interactive`.** |

### `awman chat`

| Flag | Kind | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-n, --non-interactive` | bool | false | Non-interactive (print) mode. |
| `--plan` | bool | false | Plan mode (read-only). |
| `--allow-docker` | bool | false | Mount the host Docker daemon socket. |
| `--yolo` | bool | false | Fully autonomous mode. |
| `--auto` | bool | false | Auto permission mode. |
| `--agent <name>` | string | — | Override the agent for this run. |
| `--model <name>` | string | — | Override the model for this run. |
| `--launch-mode <stdio\|acp>` | enum | `stdio` | Launch the agent over ACP (Agent Client Protocol) instead of raw container stdio. `acp` requires an agent that supports it (currently `cline`). See `docs/17-acp-mode.md`. |
| `--overlay <spec>` | repeatable string | — | Overlay expression: `dir(host:container[:ro\|rw])`, `ssh()`, `env(VAR_NAME)`, `skill(*)`, or `skill(name)`. To mount `~/.ssh` read-only, pass `--overlay ssh()`. See `docs/08-overlays.md`. |

### `awman specs`

| Subcommand | Arguments | Flags |
|---|---|---|
| `amend <work_item>` | `<work_item>` | `-n/--non-interactive`, `--allow-docker` |

### `awman new`

| Subcommand | Arguments | Flags |
|---|---|---|
| `spec` | — | `--interview`, `-n/--non-interactive`. |
| `workflow` | — | `--interview`, `-n/--non-interactive`, `--global`, `--format <toml\|yaml\|md>` (default `toml`). |
| `skill` | — | `--interview`, `-n/--non-interactive`, `--global`. |

### `awman exec`

| Subcommand | Arguments | Flags |
|---|---|---|
| `prompt <prompt>` | `<prompt>` | `-n/--non-interactive`, `--plan`, `--allow-docker`, `--yolo`, `--auto`, `--agent <name>`, `--model <name>`, `--launch-mode <stdio\|acp>`, `--overlay <spec>` (repeatable). |
| `workflow <path>` (alias `wf`) | `<path>` | `--work-item <num>`, `-n/--non-interactive`, `--plan`, `--allow-docker`, `--worktree`, `--yolo`, `--auto`, `--agent <name>`, `--model <name>`, `--launch-mode <stdio\|acp>`, `--overlay <spec>` (repeatable). `--yolo`/`--auto` imply `--worktree`. ACP is not yet driven for workflow steps; a step that resolves to `acp` is rejected pre-flight (see `docs/17-acp-mode.md`). |

`--overlay` accepts the same typed overlay expressions everywhere (CLI flags, `AWMAN_OVERLAYS`, repo/global config `overlays` array, and per-step `overlays` in workflow files): `dir(host:container[:ro|rw])`, `ssh()` (shorthand for `~/.ssh` read-only), `env(VAR_NAME)`, `skill(*)`, `skill(name)`. The legacy `--mount-ssh` flag has been removed; pass `--overlay ssh()` instead. See `docs/08-overlays.md` for the full reference.

### `awman config`

| Subcommand | Arguments | Flags |
|---|---|---|
| `show` | — | — |
| `get <field>` | `<field>` | — |
| `set <field> <value>` | `<field>`, `<value>` | `--global` (repo scope by default). |

### `awman status`

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--watch` | Continuously refresh every 3 seconds. The CLI emits `\x1b[H\x1b[J` clear sequences; the TUI swallows them. |

### `awman api`

| Subcommand | Flags |
|---|---|
| `start` | `--port <n>` (default `9876`), `--workdirs <path>` (repeatable), `--background`, `--refresh-key`, `--dangerously-skip-auth`, `--dangerously-skip-tls`. |
| `kill` | — |
| `logs` | — |
| `status` | — |

### `awman squad`

Manage the squad task daemon and scheduled tasks. The parent flags
belong to `awman squad` itself; pass them before a subcommand when using one:

| Flag | Kind | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-n, --non-interactive` | bool | false | Print the squad status summary instead of opening the TUI. |
| `--json` | bool | false | Emit JSON output. **Implies `--non-interactive`.** |

| Subcommand | Arguments | Flags |
|---|---|---|
| _(bare)_ `awman squad` | — | Inherits the parent flags above. With a TTY and neither `-n` nor `--json`, opens the singleton squad TUI tab; with `-n`/`--non-interactive` or `--json`, prints the daemon status summary instead. |
| `start` | — | `--port <n>` (u16, default `0`; `0` selects an OS-assigned port), `--background` (bool, default `false`), `--refresh-key` (bool, default `false`), `--dangerously-skip-auth` (bool, default `false`). On the first start — and with `--refresh-key` — a bearer key is minted and printed once as a shell-export snippet for `AWMAN_SQUAD_KEY`, tailored to the user's `SHELL`. `--dangerously-skip-auth` mints no key, writes no hash, warns that auth is off, and is acceptable only because the daemon binds `127.0.0.1` exclusively. |
| `stop` (alias `kill`) | — | — |
| `status` | — | `--json` (bool, default `false`). |
| `logs` | — | `-f, --follow` (bool, default `false`). |
| `add` | — | `--name <string>` (required; no default), `--description <string>` (required; no default), `--repo <path>` (default `—`; legacy synonym for `--workspace <path>`, ignored when `--workspace` is given), `--interval <string>` (default `6h`), `--agent <string>` (default `—`), `--model <string>` (default `—`), `--workspace <default\|path>` (no catalogue default; absent falls back to `--repo`, then to `default`), `--overlay <spec>` (repeatable, default empty; `dir()`/`ssh()`/`env()`/`skill()` syntax, syntax-validated at creation), `--mount-scope <cwd\|gitroot>` (default `gitroot`; only meaningful for a custom workspace that is a git repository), `--interview` (bool, default `false`), `-n, --non-interactive` (bool, default `false`; never prompt — refuses a confirmation instead of asking. Conflicts with `--interview`). |
| `list` | — | `--json` (bool, default `false`). |
| `show <name>` | `<name>` (required string) | `--json` (bool, default `false`). |
| `remove <name>` | `<name>` (required string) | `-y, --yes` (bool, default `false`). |
| `pause <name>` | `<name>` (required string) | — |
| `resume <name>` | `<name>` (required string) | — |
| `attach <name>` | `<name>` (required string) | `--container <string>` (default `—`; running container ID when multiple are active). |
| `env` | — | `--push` (bool, default `false`), `--clear` (bool, default `false`), `--json` (bool, default `false`). Reports every environment variable the daemon needs, whether it holds a value, where that value came from (`this shell` / `pushed` / `keychain`) and how long any missing one has been missing. **Values are never printed** — only whether one is present — and the leaf is not API-allowed, so it can never be driven through `/v1/commands`. `--push` re-sends every value this shell has regardless of whether it differs (the ordinary check sends only what changed); `--clear` removes the daemon's persisted keychain item without disturbing the values a running daemon already holds. |

**Task workspaces.** `--workspace default` (the default) binds the task to a durable `~/.awman/squad/tasks/<name>/workspace/` directory that is created once and never deleted, emptied, or replaced until the task is removed. Any other value binds the task to that folder or repository: the path must already exist (it is never created), and if it is not the root of a git repository the interview warns and offers to keep it or choose another. Whether a task's runs are worktree-isolated is decided once, at creation, from whether its effective root **is** a git repository root — a root-bound task always uses a worktree, and every other workspace (the default one, a plain directory, or a subdirectory of a repository) never does and is mounted exactly as given, so a run is never widened to an enclosing repository. Either way the durable per-task workspace is created and mounted into the task's containers at the `context(workflow)` path. A custom path that is a parent of the caller's current directory goes through the same parent-directory mount confirmation every other awman mount-scope flow applies — from `--workspace` as well as from the interview, and refused outright under `-n`. A plain-directory workspace has no repository to resolve agent images from, so on first run squad writes `Dockerfile.dev` and `.awman/Dockerfile.<agent>` into it from the bundled `awman init` templates, create-if-missing only.

### `awman remote`

| Subcommand | Arguments | Flags |
|---|---|---|
| `run <command…>` | trailing varargs forwarded verbatim | `--remote-addr <url>`, `--session <id>`, `-f/--follow`, `--api-key <key>`. |
| `session start <dir>` | `<dir>` | — |
| `session kill <session_id>` | `<session_id>` | — |

## Inputs and outputs

- The TUI takes over the terminal via Ratatui; ANSI escapes are forwarded to the agent's PTY.
- CLI commands write human-readable output to stdout and diagnostics to stderr.
- `--json` flips the renderer to a structured-JSON serializer.
- Containers launched by awman plumb the developer's stdin/stdout/stderr through the chosen runtime so the agent runs interactively inside the TUI.

## Configuration

- Per-repo config: `<git-root>/.awman/config.json`.
- Global config: `$HOME/.awman/config.json`.
- Environment overrides: `AWMAN_*` variables (notably `AWMAN_OVERLAYS`, `AWMAN_API_KEY`, `AWMAN_SQUAD_KEY`, `AWMAN_API_ROOT`).

Precedence (highest to lowest): CLI flag → environment variable → repo config → global config → built-in default.
# Orchestrator startup-gate flags

`chat` and `exec prompt` accept CLI-only `--startup-gate-control <DIR>` and
`--startup-gate-timeout <SECONDS>` flags. Timeout defaults to 120 seconds and
must be in `1..=3600`; specifying it without a control directory is a usage
error. These flags are unavailable to API, remote, squad, TUI, ACP, and
sandbox-class launches.

This fork's first `exec workflow` integration accepts a single agent step and
no setup, teardown, or dynamic leader. It rejects other workflow shapes before
agent dispatch because one control directory is single-use.

### Validated host snapshot

The host loader returns the parsed request together with the exact manifest
bytes that passed the bounded file, digest, and schema checks. The owned
contract is:

```rust
pub struct StartupGateSpec {
    pub control_dir: PathBuf,
    pub request: StartupGateRequest,
    pub timeout: Duration,
    pub validated_manifests: BTreeMap<String, Vec<u8>>,
}
```

Before launch, staging reloads the control directory and rejects a changed
request or manifest. It writes each staged manifest from the second loader
result's `validated_manifests`; it does not reopen a caller manifest after
validation. Request and manifest inputs must be regular, current-user-owned,
mode-`0600`, single-link files beneath a current-user-owned mode-`0700`
control directory. Reads are bounded and do not follow symlinks.

### Readiness and credential-refresh latch

`ready.json` is bounded to 64 KiB and contains `version`, a 64-character
lowercase hexadecimal `nonce`, the authoritative `container_name`, and the
verified `bindings`. Each ready binding contains `id`, `workspace_path`,
`manifest_id`, and `access`, and must match the current request. After the
orchestrator's matching `release.json` is consumed, the bootstrap writes the
two-field receipt `.released` containing exactly `version` and `nonce`;
that receipt is bounded to 4 KiB. Status records use the same protected-file
rules as request inputs.

The credential-refresh registry releases a pending lease only when the ready
container equals the container registered for that lease, the binding identity
matches the current request, the receipt nonce matches, and no
`failure.json` is present. A successful release is latched for that lease
generation. Until then, the monitor neither refreshes the host credential nor
rewrites the staged credential.

### Startup-gated image inspection

Image inspection normalizes both runtime formats through this internal
contract:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Eq, PartialEq)]
struct GateImageConfig {
    user: String,
    env: Vec<String>,
    entrypoint: Vec<String>,
    trusted: bool,
}

fn parse_gate_image_config(
    runtime_name: &str,
    raw: &[u8],
) -> Result<GateImageConfig, EngineError>
```

Docker supplies the formatted image Config object. Apple Containers supplies
its inspection array with the first variant's nested `config.config` object.
A missing, null, or empty image `Entrypoint` normalizes to an empty vector.
Malformed security fields, any nonempty image entrypoint, and image variables
`PYTHONHOME`, `PYTHONPATH`, `LD_*`, or `DYLD_*` are rejected before
container launch even when the image has the trusted capability label.
